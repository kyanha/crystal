This Blender Add-On script can be used with the Blender 2.6x
series to export meshes and scenes to the Crystal Space 3D file format.

You need to manually install this Add-on by moving the 'io_scene_cs' directory into
your 'blender/scripts/addons' folder.

See the Crystal Space manual for more information on this script at:
