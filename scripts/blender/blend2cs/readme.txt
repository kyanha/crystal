It is recommended that you use the newer conversion tool with a recent version
of Blender. The newer conversion tool can be found at:

    http://projects.blender.org/project/blend2cs

But if you want to use this version with 2.1x versions of blender, then do 
this:

put this in your /etc/profile

PYTHONHOME=/usr/lib/python2.0
export PYTHONHOME

before you run blender 2.14
