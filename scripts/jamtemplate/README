The script in this directory can set up a skeleton build system (based upon
Jam) for external Crystal Space projects.  It sets up Jam support, Autoconf
macros, a configure script, a source directory and a simple main.cpp file.

To run the script go to some directory under which you want to have the project
created, and make sure you have set the CRYSTAL environment variable.  Then,
just invoke the script.  Example:

  $CRYSTAL/scripts/jamtemplate/createproject.sh
