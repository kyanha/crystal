The script in this directory, can create a basic buildsystem (jam based) for
external CS projects. It sets up jamrules, autoconf macros, a configure script,
a source directory and a simple main.cpp file.

To run the script change to some directory where you want to have the project
created and make sure you've setup the CRYSTAL environment variable to point to
your CS source directory. Then you can invoke the script with your desired
application name and your email address as argument (the email is used as the
email of the project author). Example:

  $CRYSTAL/scripts/jamtemplate/createproject.sh testcs me@someisp.com
