2. Building and installing

2.1 Jam

 The build system is based upon Jam rather than 'make'.  If you do not yet have
 jam installed, then check your distribution for a Jam package or download the
 source and compile/install Jam yourself.  You can find the source here:

    ftp://ftp.perforce.com/pub/jam/

 You will need at least version 2.4.

2.2 Building

 1. Go to the top-level directory in the project tree.
 2.  Run "./configure", possibly with some options, if you wish.  You can see a
    list of possible options by invoking configure with the "--help".
 3. Run "jam".

2.3 Installing

 1. Build the project.
 2. Ensure that you have write permissions to the install directories. On
    Unix/Linux this usually means that you need to be the 'root' user.
 3. Run "jam install".
