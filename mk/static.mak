# static.mak
#
#	A makefile for synthesizing hard references to symbols within libraries
#	in order to ensure that those libraries are linked into the
#	application.
#
#	When Crystal Space applications are configured to dynamically load
#	plug-in modules at run-time (that is, the makefile variable USE_PLUGINS
#	is "yes" or the configure script was invoked with --enable-plugins,
#	which is the default), the code for plug-in modules is packaged into a
#	dynamic-link library.  On the other hand, when applications are
#	configured to link statically (that is, USE_PLUGINS=no or
#	--disable-plugins was specified), plug-in modules must be linked
#	directly into the application (since they can not be loaded at
#	run-time).
#
#	In this case, the code for plug-in modules is packaged into a static
#	library.  In order to ensure that the linker actually incorporates
#	these libraries into the application, it is necessary to force a hard
#	reference to symbols within the library.  If this reference is not
#	made, then today's so-called "smart" linkers will not actually link the
#	library into the application even though the library is mentioned in
#	the linkage statement.
#
#	This makefile facilitates the process of static linking by synthesizing
#	a C++ source file which contains hard references to symbols within each
#	plug-in module.  The synthesis is accomplished by examining the
#	makefile variable SCF.STATIC, and INF.PROJECT and generating
#	invocations to the SCF macros SCF_REGISTER_STATIC_LIBRARY() and
#	SCF_REGISTER_FACTORY_FUNC() for each module listed in SCF.STATIC.  The
#	synthesized C++ file is then added to the application's dependency
#	list, with the result that it is both compiled and linked into the
#	final application.
#
#	The contents of the SCF.STATIC list can change if the user
#	re-configures the makefile system or modifies the list of desired
#	plug-in modules in CS/mk/user.mak.  This makefile is smart enough to
#	recognize such events and regenerate the synthesized C++ file as
#	necessary.
#
# IMPORTS
#	The makefile variable SCF.STATIC is examined during synthesis of the
#	C++ source file which symbolically references each plug-in module.
#	Each item listed in SCF.STATIC should be the core name of a plug-in
#	module (such as `soft3d', `vfs', etc.)
#
#	The synthesized C++ file must be regenerated when certain external
#	events occur (such as when the user alters the list of desired plug-in
#	modules in CS/mk/user.mak).  The list of resources which must be
#	monitored in order to facilitate automatic regeneration, is contained
#	in the makefile variable DEP.LIBREF.EXTRA (below).
#
# EXPORTS
#	If the project is configured to link plug-in modules into applications
#	statically (that is, if USE_PLUGINS=no or --disable-plugins was
#	specified), then the makefile variable DEP.EXE is augmented with the
#	name of the object file corresponding to the synthesized C++ file.
#
#	The name of the synthesized C++ file is contained in the makefile
#	variable SRC.LIBREF.  The location of the file is mentioned in
#	DIR.LIBREF.
