# required.mak
#
#	This makefile component sets the value of the MSVC.PLUGINS.REQUIRED
#	variable.  MSVC.PLUGINS.REQUIRED supplements the list of plug-in
#	modules defined by its brother variable PLUGINS (see CS/mk/user.mak).
#
#	Like the PLUGINS variable, MSVC.PLUGINS.REQUIRED defines a list of
#	plug-in modules.  Unlike PLUGINS, however, MSVC.PLUGINS.REQUIRED
#	defines the list of plug-in modules for which Visual-C++ DSP project
#	files must be generated, unconditionally, regardless of the currently
#	configured makefile environment.
#
#	Because MSVC.PLUGINS.REQUIRED supplements PLUGINS, the Visual-C++
#	project file generation mechanism is able to generate DSP files for
#	Windows-specific plug-in modules even when the makefiles are
#	configured for a different platform, such as Unix, which would not
#	normally process Windows-specific modules.
