This is an example of usage for loading an animated mesh which has its morph targets split
in several files.

This example has been tailored for the default 3DS model from the FaceGen software.

Please download and put the following file in the same directory as this readme:
http://www.facegen.com/download/Jane_hi_all_3ds.zip

Then load your model as any other CS model, for example with viewmesh:
viewmesh data/jane/jane.cslib

The file contains also a second example where the model files are loaded directly from
this directory, without being packed in a ZIP archive.
