; All the entries that start with "Device.Joystick." followed by the platform
; name (e.g. "Unix", "Win32", "MacOS/X") are probed. The remainder of the key
; name following "Device.Joystick.{platform}." is arbitrary, but must be unique
; per key. The first entry found for a platform corresponds to the first
; joystick, the second key to the second joystick, etc. (We use a numeric
; suffix here, but the numeric in the suffix does not actually define the
; joystick's number; only the order of entries does.) The value after the "="
; describes the actual joystick device.
