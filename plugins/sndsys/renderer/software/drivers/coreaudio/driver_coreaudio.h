/*  A.M. 
 * 
 *  I don't own a mac, so this driver is based off the old Crystal Space CoreAudio driver 
 *  by Matt Reda (2001) and documentation found on the web.  
 *
 *  To keep things simple, this driver takes audio formatted just like the Linux OSS and Windows DirectSound drivers
 *  take audio - 16 bit signed little endian.  Supporting 8 bit wouldn't be hard, but there's probably no reason to do
 *  that.  Supporting Big Endian and 24/32 bit samples would require a little bit of change to the software renderer,
 *  but not a huge amount.  The renderer itself already accumulates and normalizes samples using a 32 bit buffer size,
 *  and it has to perform all its work in native system endianess, so there's actually an extra conversion back to 
 *  little endian on current Mac systems.
 *
 *  The other drivers are specifically threaded - the driver itself is a csRunnable and kicks off its own background thread
 *  to push data to the OS.  Since CoreAudio uses callbacks (ones which thankfully dont seem nearly as limited as the winmm
 *  callbacks in terms of supported operations), we use the callbacks as our 'background thread' here.
 *
 *
