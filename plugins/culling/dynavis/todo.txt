- Seperate the outline info from csObjectModel. An outline is not attached
  to a model but to an instance of a model (perhaps make
  csObjectModelInstance?).

	OR

  Implement an outline cache which IS attached to csObjectModel and let
  model instances use an entry from that cache.

- Improve filling of outline in coverage buffer. Clamp outline to Z=0
  plane instead of rejecting write objects that are clipped by that plane.

- Make a new line draw function in the coverage buffer that isn't
  concerned about left/right lines.

- Split coverage buffer into tiles and implement delayed writing.

- Predict quality of occluders.

- VPT (Visible Point Tracking) and keeping an object visible for a
  random number of frames.

- Automatic rebalancing of KD-tree.
