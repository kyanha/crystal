You will need to install the MikMod package.  You can obtain it from here:

http://mikmod.raphnet.net/

Grab the latest stable package.

Notes:

If you compile the MikMod library with thread support you will need to add
-lpthread to the final Crystal Space excutable (adding -lpthread to the
sndmod.so plugin does not seem to work). If you compile MikMod without thread
support (./configure --disable-threads), then no such problem occurs.
