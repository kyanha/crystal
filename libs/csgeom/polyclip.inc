/*
   This is the well-known Southerland-Hodgemen polygon clipping algorythm
   which works by successively clipping target polygon against every clipper
   polygon edge.

   In the following we call the "clipping" (or "clipper") polygon the polygon
   against which we're clipping, and "clipped" polygon the polygon that we
   are clipping against the clipper.

   The algorythm does not care about the vertex order of both polygons
   (clockwise or anti-clockwise). However, the clipping polygon should be
   convex while the clipped polygon can be arbitrary.
