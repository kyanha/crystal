 * Triangle Bintree mesh shared data.<br>
 *
 * General construction of a BinTree and the indexing of vertices:<br>
 *
 * The top level triangle consists of vertices (0,3,2), triangle
 * vertices are enumerated counter clock-wise.
 * Va is the top of the triangle, Vc is the new split point or center,
 * V0 is the left coord w.r.t. vc and V1 is the right coord w.r.t. vc.
 * This triangle has 2 children (the Bin in BinTree) which are T0 and T1,
 * (0,1,n+1) and (0,n,1), respectively (the left and the right child with
 * respect to vc).<br>
 * Each sub triangle can be split again, 1st the left into (1,2,0) and
 * (1,n+1,2) and the right into (1,0,3) and (1,3,n).  For the left and right
 * sub triangle, 1 becomes va and 2 becomes vc for the left child and
 * 3 becomes vc for the right child, etc.
 * A triangle is identified by its Vc coordinate since that is unique, Va,
 * V0 and V1 are shared with other triangles.  Therefor all information
 * that it stores is associated with Vc.
 * Each sub level in the tree adds twice as many triangles as were present
 * in the previous level.  So with each level required storage double
 * That only leaves a problem for the top most triangle which needs to
 * store its left and right children from somwhere.  In this implementation,
 * this info is stored at index n and n+1.
 * This scheme allows very fast computation of the indices which represent
 * the parent or children of any given triangle.
 *<pre>
 * This diagram shows the index numbers, names for the top level triangle
 * (va,vc,v0,v1) and to map coordinates of the top level vertices.
 *
 *        0,0      3     size,0
 *    (va) 0 +-----+-----+ n (v1)
 *           |\    |    /
 *           | \   T1  /
 *           |  \  |  /
 *           |   \ | /
 *           |    \|/
 *         2 +-T0--+ 1 (vc)
 *           |    /  
 *           |   /
 *           |  /
 *           | /
 *           |/
 *   0,size  + n+1 (v0)
 *</pre>
 * Neighbours:<br>
 * If the triangles 2 and 3 are split again, their vc vertices will lie
 * halfway between vertices 0 and 1.  They will produce 4 children which
 * all share this common vc, however since the triangles (2 and 3) are
 * seperate triangles, the vc point is stored twice, once for 2 and once for 3.
 * To keep the mesh from cracking, if 2 is split, 3 must split also. No
 * T-junctions are allowed.  Because of this rule, 2 and 3 are considered
 * neighbours and they form a split diamond.
 * There is no easy way to know which triangle is the neighbour of another,
 * for this reason neigbour indices are precomputed and stored in a table.
 * All other indices are readily available from the given triangle's own index.
