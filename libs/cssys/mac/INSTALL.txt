[1] REQUIREMENTS

1) Compiler: Metrowerks CodeWarrior Pro 4 or later.
2) Include Files: Universal Includes 3.2 from Apple
3) Libraries: libjpeg, linpng, and zlib.  The easiest place to get these is to
get them from my web site <http://www.ultranet.com/~rbate>.  The libraries
from my web site already have been built so they are ready to go.
4) Directory layout:  The three libraries mentioned above need to be placed into "cryst"
if they were not unpacked into this folder.

[2] GETTING READY TO DEVELOP

1. Unpack the includes in libs:cssys:mac:includes.sit.  If you used Stuffit Expander to
unpack the includes, move the folder that is in "includes Folder" into "mac" then throw
out "includes Folder".

2. Unpack the compressed projects files in mk:mwcw:projects.sit.  If you used Stuffit Expander to
unpack the project files, move the files that are in "projects Folder" into
mwcw then throw out "projects Folder".  If you want to work with the glide renderer then unpack
more_projects.sit.

[3] WORKING WITH THE CRYSTAL SPACE PROJECTS

There are 17 Crystal Space projects in the mwcw folder: 

2 projects that build static libraries:
CrystLib.prj	- generates the static linked library, which includes the
				  majority of the code for Crystal Space
CSWSLib.prj		- generates the static linked library, which includes the
				  code for the Crystal Space Windowing System

8 projects that build shared libraries:
Driver2D.prj			- generates the 2D Graphics shared library.
NetworkDriverNull.prj	- generates the null network driver shared library.
NetworkMgrNull.prj  	- generates the null network manager shared library.
SftRndr.prj				- generates the SoftwareRender shared library, which includes the 3D graphics
						  driver for software rasterization.
SoundDriver.prj 		- generates the mac sound driver shared library.
SoundDriverNull.prj  	- generates the null sound driver shared library.
SoundRender.prj			- generates the software sound render shared library.
SoundRenderNull.prj		- generates the null sound render manager shared library.
GlideRender.prj			- generates the Glide Render shared library.

6 projects that generate applications
CSRegSvr.prj	- generates the application which registers the shared libraries.
CSWSTest.prj	- generates the application which tests the Crystal Space Windowing System.
MazeD.prj		- generates the Crystal Space Editor.
Primedit.prj	- generates another Crystal Space Editor.
Simple.prj  	- generates a Simple Crystal Space application.
Walktest.prj	- generates another Simple Crystal Space application.

and 1 project that builds other projects
MakeShared.prj	- Makes sure all of the shared libraries and CSRegSvr are up to date.

Generally you will just build an application and all of the other pieces will be built for you.
All of the resulting libraries and applications will be placed in the src directory.

1. Open MakeShared.prj in CodeWarrior and make it.

2. Switch back to the finder select all of the files that end in .shlb
in the src folder and drop them on the csregsvr application.

3. Choose an application to build.  I generally start with walktest.  Make it.

4. Make sure the world file large.zip is in the src folder.

5. You're all set to run the application.

[3] FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (Well, not really)

1) There are a lot of warnings during compile.

Well, that's normal as long as there are no errors.

2a) What is this "ignored 'fopen' (code) in MSL.C.PPC.Lib" link warning?

Inorder to keep from changing a lot of crystal space to fix the differences
in path separators, I wrote a new version of fopen which handles the path separators
then calls the same routines that the MSL library version of fopen does.  The warning
is harmless and you should only worry if you don't get the warning message.

2b) What is this "ignored 'fgets' (code) in MSL.C.PPC.Lib" link warning?

Inorder to keep from changing a lot of crystal space to fix the differences
in line endings, I wrote a new version of fgets which handles the line endings
then calls the same routines that the MSL library version of fgets does.  The warning
is harmless and you should only worry if you don't get the warning message.

3) I need to get to the command line, where is it?

When you launch the application, if you hold down the option key a command line
dialog will pop up.  If the command line that you are typing needs to be the same
all the time, create a 'str#' resource with an id of 1024 and make the first string in it
the command line you want and it will be automaticly used.  Also, if you drop a text file
on the application, the first 255 characters of the file are read and used as the command line.
