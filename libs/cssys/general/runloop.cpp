/*
 * Implementation of csDefaultRunLoop() for platforms which do not otherwise
 * require any special facilities for creating an application run-loop.  Note
 * that this is only useful for platforms which can perform all user
 * interaction without contact with the host environment beyond that provided
 * by the various plugin modules (usually canvases).  Other platforms which
 * require more in-depth interaction with the host-environment in order to
 * implement an application run-loop will have to provide their own
 * implementation of csDefaultRunLoop() in place of this one.  Examples of
 * environments which can not use this default implementation are Apple's Cocoa
 * frameworks in which the application run-loop is already provided by the
 * NSApplication class, and BeOS's Application Kit in which the application
 * run-loop is already provided by the BApplication class.
