#	Build-time configuration options for the NextStep platform.
#
# *NOTE*
#	The NextStep 3.3 Objective-C++ compiler has a code generation bug
#	which is triggered by CS/libs/csengine/covtree.cpp and which results
#	in invalid computation of the coverage tree.  The problem occurs when
#	the compiler applies strength-reduction optimization, thus we work
#	around the problem by specifying -fno-strength-reduce.
#
# *NOTE*
#	On non-NeXT platforms, symbols within dynamically loaded modules are
#	considered private unless explicitly exported.  On NextStep, however,
#	all symbols within a plug-in module are public.  Since many Crystal
#	Space plug-in modules link with various Crystal Space static libraries
#	name collisions will surely occur.  To work around this problem, we
#	make an addition to DO.SHARED.PLUGIN.POSTAMBLE so that it strips all
#	unnecessary public symbols from the plug-in module.  This is fairly
#	decent insurance against symbolic collisions between modules even when
#	they link against the same libraries.  The only serious drawback to
#	this approach is that it makes symbolic debugging of plug-in modules
#	impossible.  This approach is different than the one used by the
#	MacOS/X Server and OpenStep ports of Crystal Space.  For those ports,
#	it is possible to instruct the dynamic linker (DYLD) to ignore
#	duplicate symbols at load time, thus there is no need to strip symbols
#	from the plug-in modules.  Unfortunately, however, the NextStep RLD
#	facility does not provide a mechanism for ignoring duplicate symbols at
#	load time.  It is possible, though, to attempt loading a module and
#	then parse the error stream if the load fails.  For each duplicate
#	symbol mentioned in the error stream, call rld_forget_symbol() then
#	attempt to reload the module.  Unfortunately, there are two problems
#	with this approach which make it unusable.  First, RLD is sufficiently
#	buggy that it actually crashes the program if rld_forget_symbol() is
#	called after an unsuccessful load.  Second, it is apparently impossible
#	to "forget" symbols which have been linked into the application itself,
#	thus there is no way to resolve a collision between a symbol in the
#	application and one in a plug-in module.  Thus, we must resort to the
#	DO.SHARED.PLUGIN.POSTAMBLE technique of stripping the plug-in of all of
#	its public symbols before ever attempting to load it in the first
#	place.
