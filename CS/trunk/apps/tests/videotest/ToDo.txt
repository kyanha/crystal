-abstractize the theora ogg file format. create a plugin for that (kinda like plgsndsyswav)
	*need to figure out the interfaces for this
-create a loader (based on plgsndsysloader?)

-a theora ogg file usually contains a bunch of information on the video and video and sound streams
-then there are a series of streams. might be more than one audio or video stream(?)
-gonna go for just one for now
-use iDataBuffer to store info from theora



-currently, the generic loader isn't linked with the actual cs loader, since I've yet to figure out how that works
-the theora loader currently reads the headers and sort of decides if it's a theora vid or not
-also, loading isn't implemented through the vfs yet
-still need to add the plugin for the player
