     * Helper class to properly construct the diffusion dof post effect.
     * As the number of layers of the effect is dependant of the screen
     * resolution one can not use xml to define the effect.
     * 
     * The DDOF effect uses the heat difusion equation to perform a 
     * variable width blur based on the Circle of Confusion of each
     * pixel. This method generates a tridiagonal system, so resolving
     * the system the final pixel color is obtained.
     *
     * The DDOF effect consists of 3 kinds of layers:
     *    build_abc - this layer calculates the coefficients (a, b, c) of
     * the tridiagonal system. Each row(or column) of the output texture is
     * a whole system.
     *    reduce - this layer reduces the number of variables in the system
     * by half leaving only variables with odd indices.
     *    resolve - given a solution of a reduced system, that is, the odd
     * variables, this layer resolves the even variables by using backsubstitution
     *
     * Thus the system is recursively reduced until is reached a 2 or 3 variable
     * system that can be solved fast. Then we recursively perform the
     * backsubtitution. This algorithm is known as Cyclic Reduction.
     *
		 * Notice that the DDOFHelper must be created on heap due to it being
		 * referenced by the PostEffect (if used the setup view callback).
