  * \param searchCollectionOnly is true by default which means that it will only
  * find materials/factories/... from current collection if that is given.
  * \param checkDupes if true then materials, textures,
  * and mesh factories will only be loaded if they don't already exist
  * in the entire engine (ignoring regions). By default this is false because
  * it is very legal for different world files to have different objects
  * with the same name. Only use checkDupes == true if you know that your
