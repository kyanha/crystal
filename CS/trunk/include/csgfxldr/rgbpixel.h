// Implementation Note: Eric Sunshine <sunshine@sunshineco.com>      1999/02/09
//
// Certain portions of the Crystal Space code have strict requirements about
// the sizes of the structures RGBcolor, RGBPixel, and RGBPalEntry.  In
// particular, some pieces of code make these assumptions:
//
//    sizeof(RGBcolor) == 3       (byte:rgb)
//    sizeof(RGBPixel) == 4       (byte:rgb + byte:alpha)
//    sizeof(RGBPalEntry) == 8    (byte:rgb + long:count)
//
// Originally, RGBPixel and RGBPalEntry were implemented as subclasses of
// RGBcolor.  RGBPixel added a byte-sized "alpha" variable, and RGBPalEntry added
// a longword-sized "count" variable.  Thus, the original implementation made
// the assumption that the compiler would not pad out the RGBcolor structure.
//
// Unfortunately in some environments (such as the NextStep compiler on m68k
// hardware) the compiler does pad RGBcolor thus breaking the original
// assumptions about structure sizes.  In such cases, RGBcolor is padded out
// to 4 bytes instead of 3 and RGBPixel is padded out to 6 bytes instead of 4.
//
// This padding results in problems in code which makes assumptions about the
// sizes of each structure.  In practice, problems were observed in code which
// expected RGBPixel to be 4 bytes.
//
// To work around this problem, I re-implemented RGBPixel and RGBPalEntry such
// that they are no longer derived from RGBcolor.  An unfortunate side-effect
// of this re-implementation is that code is no longer inherited, and is thus
// duplicated in each class.  However, except for this minor point, the size of
// each structure should now be more stable between various compilers.
