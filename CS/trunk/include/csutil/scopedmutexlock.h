/**
 * This is a utility class for locking a Mutex. If A MutexLock class is
 * created it locks the mutex, when it is destroyed it unlocks the Mutex
 * again. So locking a mutex can happen by creating a MutexLock object on the
 * stack. The compiler will then take care that the Unlock calls will be done
 * in each case.
