/**
 * A weak reference. This is a reference to a reference counted object
 * but in itself it doesn't increment the ref counter. As soon as the
 * object is destroyed (i.e. the last REAL reference to it is removed)
 * all weak references pointing to that object are cleared. This kind of
 * reference is useful if you want to maintain some kind of cached objects
 * that can safely be removed as soon as the last reference to it is gone.
 * 
 * Note: this class assumes that the T type implements at least the following
 * functions:
 * - AddRefOwner()
 * - RemoveRefOwner()
 *
 * \remarks An extended explanation on smart pointers - how they work and what
 *   type to use in what scenario - is contained in the User's manual, 
 *   section "Correctly Using Smart Pointers".
 * 
 * Although csWeakRef<> implements the necessary operators to transparently use
 * it like an actual pointer, this usage is <em>not</em> thread-safe: when
 * using multiple threads, it can happen that a weak pointer appears valid in
 * one thread, but is being destroyed (or has been destroyed) in another thread.
 * For <b>thread-safe usage</b>, convert the weak pointer to a csRef<> first
 * by using a Get() method: This ensures that a valid returned pointer stays
 * valid and that an invalid pointer is returned if the object is being
 * destroyed.
