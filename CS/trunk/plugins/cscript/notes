Notes on cscript, cspython, and csjava

The new architecture will consist of

Under plugins:
common
cspython
csjava
csjava/kaffe
csjava/sun
csjava/ms

Under scripts:
java
python

common contains the swig interface files

cspython defines the "C" python library interface and the python swig interface

csjava defines the main java library and java swig interface

csjava/kaffe contains the java wrapper functions for the Kaffe Java distro
csjava/sun contains the wrapper for the Sun Java distro
csjava/ms contains the wrapper for the MS Java distro

java will contain any java side scripts
python will contain any python side scripts


Currently the java library will only work on Linux/Kaffe until more research
is done on how to support the various java libraries
