/* This driver uses the windows MMSystem wave output functions.  This system has been around forever and it sometimes behaves a bit fickle.
 *
 * This driver kicks off its own thread to attempt to ensure that data is fed to the underlying system in a timely manner.  Additionally, MMSystem
 *  kicks off its own thread in the process space as well.  This means if you use this driver you get 2 extra threads.  Threads are cheap, don't
 *  sweat it.
 *
 * The MMSystem thread performs all the callbacks to the application, but it's not safe to do any work inside this callback - you're extremely limited
 *  in what functions you can safely call.  See the note above the definition of waveOutProc in wodrv.cpp for a list.  The callback receives blocks that
 *  the driver is done with.  All we do here is put those into a queue to be refilled and handed back to the driver.
 *
 * Our own background thread sits in a loop with a sleep(0), waiting for free blocks to become available.  When they are it calls back into the renderer
 *  to have it fill them.  This seems somewhat backwards, having the driver call the renderer, but since the linux driver seems to work fine, and this
 *  driver has always done things this way, it's the easiest way to approach this without creating new problems elsewhere.
 *
 * Note that this means the Software Renderer call path invoked from here should be thread safe (real mutexes should lock all the data that may be accessed
 *  by both the call path from this background thread and the main application thread).
 *
 * If you alter or create any code that touches EmptyBlocks, make sure you lock mutex_EmptyBlocks while accessing it, and release it (from all exit paths)
 *  afterward.
 *
 *
 *  This plugin respects the following configuration options:
 *  Sound.WaveOut.BufferLength - A floating point value specifying the length of buffers (in seconds) created to
 *                                     hold data from the renderer (streaming AND static audio). (default is 0.05 seconds)
 *                               Increasing this value will cause delays in sound actions (button clicks are especially noticable)
 *  Sound.WaveOut.DeviceIndexOverride - An integer value 0 - (Number of devices-1) overriding the default selection of output device.
