You will need to install the mikmod package you can get here:
http://www.mikmod.org

Grab the latest stable (i tested with 3.1.9).

Notes:
If you compile the mikmod lib with thread support you will need to add -lpthread to the
final CS excutable (adding -lpthread to the sndmod.so plugin does not work)
If you compile the mikmod lib without thread support (./configure --disable-threads)
no such problems with adding pthread will arise. So it's up to you.
