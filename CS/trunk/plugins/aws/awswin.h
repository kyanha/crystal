*   This file details the interface of awsWindow awsComponents.  Windows, while they are just normal awsComponents, have some    *
* special properties that most other awsComponents will not have.  For example, windows are moveable, hideable, maximizeable, *
* windows can be minimized, closed, and they can sit on top of or below other windows.  Windows, while being peers, also   *
* have a depth ordering that is implicit in their hierarchy.                                                               *
