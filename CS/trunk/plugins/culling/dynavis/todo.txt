- Seperate the outline info from csObjectModel. An outline is not attached
  to a model but to an instance of a model (perhaps make
  csObjectModelInstance?).
	OR
  Implement an outline cache which IS attached to csObjectModel and let
  model instances use an entry from that cache.

- Instead of taking world space AABB and then transforming that into
  another camera AABB (which may make the AABB a lot too big) we should
  take the world space OBB and transform that to camera AABB instead.
  This is for TestRectangle and also AppendWriteQueue. Should improve
  visibility culling a bit.

- Improve filling of outline in coverage buffer. Clamp outline to Z=0
  plane instead of rejecting write objects that are clipped by that plane.

- Implement delayed writing on tiles.

- Predict quality of occluders.

- VPT (Visible Point Tracking).

- Automatic rebalancing of KD-tree.

- Only calculate planes, edges, active edges in model when REALLY
  needed (i.e. delay).

- Also process history and VPT for kdtree nodes.

- Seperate all camera dependend/history data so we can use Dynavis
  for multiple camera positions.
