 * front to back ordering.

 * in the tree they are not immediatelly distributed over the
 * nodes but instead they remain in the main node until it is really
 * needed to distribute them. The advantage of this is that you can
 * insert/remove a lot of objects in the tree and then do the distribution
 * calculation only once. This is more efficient and it also generates
 * a better tree as more information is available then.
