/**
  This class contains
  basic code to read font information and build appropriate bitmaps in 
  OpenGL.  It acts as a GL 'font server'.  You add a font by passing
  in a FontDef struct (see graph2d.h), and the server will add it to
  the list of fonts.  Destruction of the server will free up all the
  bitmaps currently in use.

  To write a series of characters, set the color and position using
  glColor(r,g,b) and glRasterPos2i(x,y)  Note that the raster
  position points to the lower left corner of the first character!
  Then call WriteChars() with the string to print.  If you want to
  use a different font than the default font (the first font built
  in the server) there exists a version of WriteChars() for that
  as well
