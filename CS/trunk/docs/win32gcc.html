<h1>Crystal Space installation with GCC for Windows</h1>

Written by <a href="mailto:sgalbrai@krl.org">Seth Galbraith</a>

<p>

Andrew Zabolotny, myself and others are working on instructions for using
Crystal Space with a GNU compiler for windows, but it isn't easy because of
the many different versions of the GNU Windows compiler and problems with
some Windows header files containing non-standard code used by Microsoft.
If you're interested in helping out with this project, contact me or one of
the other Crystal Space developers.

<h2>Files you will need</h2>

<pre>
<a href="ftp://go.cygnus.com/pub/sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/cygwin/latest/full.exe"
>full.exe</a>               - Cygwin GNU Windows compiler
<a href="ftp://ftp.linuxgames.com/crystal/support/winlibs14.zip"
>winlibs14.zip</a>          - compiled zip, jpeg, and png libraries for Windows
<a href="ftp://ftp.linuxgames.com/crystal/nasm/nasm-0.98e-bin-w32.zip"
>nasm-0.98e-bin-w32.zip</a> - NASM (Netwide Assembler) for Windows
</pre>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Unzip the compiled libraries into the same folder where you
    unzipped Crystal Space. (<a href="#bugs">See Bugs</a>.)
<li>Unzip NASM somwhere.
<li>Run the Cygwin full.exe installer.
<li>To use GCC and NASM you need to make sure you have the
    appropriate bin directories in your PATH.
    Here's my own PATH as an example:
<pre>
SET PATH=C:\Cygnus\cygwin-b20\H-i586-cygwin32\bin;C:\nasm\bin\win32;%PATH%
</pre>
<li>Now just CD to your Crystal Space directory, run make and follow
    the instructions.
</ul>
