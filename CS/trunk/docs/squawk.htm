<h2><a name="#about"></a>What it's about</h2>

I'm making a multiplayer action role-playing game.
Currently this application just tests a few ideas:
<ul>
<li>multiple views for split-screen play
<li>sky box environment map
<li>animated 3d sprite character
</ul>

<hr>

<h2><a name="#control"></a>Controls</h2>

<pre>
Esc  exit program

1  show run action
2  show stand action
3  show pain action
4  show death action
5  show attack action
6  show jump action
</pre>

<h3>Upper view</h3>

<pre>
up arrow     look up
down arrow   look down
left arrow   look left
right arrow  look right

home         look up and left
end          look down and left
page up      look up and right
page down    look down and right

insert       roll left
delete       roll right
</pre>

<h3>Lower left view</h3>

<pre>
w  tilt camera up
s  tilt camera down
a  turn camera left
d  turn camera right
</pre>

<h3>Lower right view</h3>

<pre>
i  tilt camera up
k  tilt camera down
j  turn camera left
l  turn camera right
</pre>

<h2><a name="#bugs"></a>Known Bugs</h2>

<ul>

<li>Converting 24 bit images to 8 bit palettes is <em>very</em>
slow and TXTMODE=24bit doesn't work for non-lightmapped polygons.
The skybox uses 24 bit JPEG images again so it takes a <em>long</em>
time to start in 16 or 8 bit.

<li>The feild-of-view should be FrameHeight / 2 for the lower views,
but this causes a Floating Point Exception when I try to look at the sprite.

<li>The sprite is not centered correctly.  This looks
like it's a bug in the convertor I used.

<li>Floating point exceptions in DrawPolygonFX

</ul>

<h2><a name="#history"></a>History</h2>

<h3>September 26, 1999 Seth Galbraith</h3>
<ul>
<li>A lot of restructuring
<li>Replaced CS sprite with three .mdl format models
<li>Changed fixed-size arrays into csVector subclasses
<li>Created sqkView class which contains multiple csViews
<li>version 16
</ul>

<h3>September 21, 1999 Seth Galbraith</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jorrit fixed the bug where texture projection was always
centered around the middle of the screen
<li>I merged squawk.txt and history.txt into this document
<li>Changed "room" to "skybox" throughout squawk.cpp
<li>Added AddViewVertex method that takes relative coordinates
<li>two views are now always linked like a single concave view
<li>the other views are now always independent
<li>version 15
</ul>

<h3>September 17, 1999 Seth Galbraith</h3>
<ul>
<li>centers of views adjusted depending on whether the views are linked
<li>replaced sky box textures with big 512x512 JPEG images
<li>version 14
</ul>

<h3>September 4, 1999 Seth Galbraith</h3>
<ul>
<li>converted all textures to 8 bit PNG format
<li>disabled lighting and mipmapping for the sky box
<li>version 13
</ul>

<h3>August 25, 1999  Seth Galbraith</h3>
<ul>
<li>load and display an animated 3d sprite
<li>version 12
</ul>

<h3>August 4, 1999  Eric Sunshine</h3>
<ul>
<li>fixed problem with handling of texture manager; was allocating palette prior
  to world->Prepare(), whereas it should have allocated done after
<li>console now latches palette colors before and after world has been prepared;
  thus allowing it to be used at any time, rather than only prior to world
  preparation
<li>background is now erased prior to activation of 3D views in order to clear
  away console text which incorrectly appeared in gaps between views
<li>version 11
</ul>

<h3>July 29, 1999  Seth Galbraith</h3>
<ul>
<li>space bar links and unlinks view controls
<li>allocate palette before creating console
<li>version 10
</ul>

<h3>July 27, 1999  Jorrit Tyberghein</h3>
<ul>
<li>load textures from squawk.zip
<li>version 9
</ul>

<h3>July 26, 1999  Seth Galbraith</h3>
<ul>
<li>named sector (sectors must be named for lighting)
<li>added console (palette is odd, font too big)
<li>version 8
</ul>

<h3>July 24, 1999  Seth Galbraith</h3>
<ul>
<li>misc updates based on CVS changes
<li>moved stuff around, then moved it back :-)
<li>version 7
</ul>

<h3>July 23, 1999  Seth Galbraith</h3>
<ul>
<li>added terragen environment map textures
<li>version 6
</ul>

<h3>July 21, 1999  Seth Galbraith</h3>
<ul>
<li>use configuration file "squawk.cfg"
<li>added $(CSSCRIPT.LIB) to dependencies in squawk.mak
<li>version 5
</ul>

<h3>July 21, 1999  Seth Galbraith</h3>
<ul>
<li>use configuration file "squawk.cfg"
<li>added $(CSSCRIPT.LIB) to dependencies in squawk.mak
<li>version 4
</ul>

<h2><a name="#todo"></a>Things remaining to be done</h2>

<h3>Controls</h3>

<ul>
<li>Better keyboard and mouse handling
<li>Multiple controls that can be used simultaneously
<li>Control character rather than camera
<li>Gamepad and Joystick support
</ul>

<h3>Cameras</h3>

<ul>
<li>Chase cameras that follow characters
<li>Adjust FOV in split views
<li>Use a plain text file with information for configuring views.
(Probably described as a list of sqkViews which are described as
a list of csViews which are described as a list of 2d coordinates.
with an arbitrary number of each type of object allowed.)
</ul>

<h3>Content</h3>

<ul>
<li>A local environment to move around in
<li>Create a Squawk or general Crystal Space skybox class
<li>Make sky textures a command line and config option.
The base name, the extension for each direction, and the
file type extension could all be options.  For example:
<pre>
SKYNAME=snowy
SKYEXT1=_up _dn _lt _rt _fr _bk
SKYEXT2=.tga
</pre>
</ul>
