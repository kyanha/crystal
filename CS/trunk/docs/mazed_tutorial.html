  Simple MazeD tutorial
</H1>
<P>
This tutorial is a text Andrew Zabolotny. I hope some kind people will expand
this to show also the more advanced features of MazeD. I heard, that using
MazeD you can even create whole worlds, and I would really like to know how.
<P>

  General
</H2>
<P>
First, there are two (and a half :-) toolbars. There is the "toolbox" (top-left),
the "window manager" (bottom-left) toolbars and the status bar (bottom right).
<P>
By clicking RMB on a button you enter "setup" mode for that button (if it
has one). For example, by clicking RMB on the "create polygon" button, a
new subtoolbar opens with "connect any number of vertices", "triangle strip",
"quad strip" submodes. By clicking LMB on desired mode you set the current
editing mode.

  Creating a Sprite
</H2>
<P>
Well, a quick tour: Select menu "Model-&gt;Create-&gt;Sprite". Then choose
the "Insert vertex" tool (the button with a pivot (a little flag)). Then
click in one of 3D View windows several times to create several vertices,
this way:
<P ALIGN=Center>
<IMG SRC="img/tutor1.gif" WIDTH="163" HEIGHT="205">
<P>
Now choose "triangle fan" tool (RMB click on button with a polygon painted
on it, then choose (LMB) the button with a triangle fan). Click first on
center vertex (it will go red), then on vertex 2, then on 3, then on 5, then
on 4, then on 2. You should have got something like this:
<P ALIGN=Center>
<IMG SRC="img/tutor2.gif" WIDTH="163" HEIGHT="205">
<P>
<P>
Now, to make a 3D body of it, you should move the center vertex a bit "higher"
or "deeper". For this, deselect all vertices (RMB on "select" button (a big
PLUS sign surrounded by vertices), then click __RMB__ on "deselect vertices"
button (a MINUS sign surrounded by vertices)).
<P>
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="2">
  <TR>
    <TD><I>sidenote</I></TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>note that if you click LMB on "deselect vertices" button, you enter into
      that mode (i.e. it becomes current). But if you click RMB on "deselect vertices"
      button, you just deselect all vertices and revert to original tool.</TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Now select only the central vertex. Enter "select vertices" mode, then go
around vertex one and press LMB. Now drag the box so that it contains vertex
1. Finally, drag vertex 1 in one of side windows (where the body is seen
as a thin line) in either direction. You will see what you got.
<P>
Now you can rotate the body a bit and look what you did. For this choose
"rotate coordinate axis" button on window manager toolbar (three axis surrounded
by arrows), press LMB (or RMB? :-) in one of windows and move it.
<P>
Exercice: try clicking RMB on each button of toolbox and window manager toolbars
:-)
