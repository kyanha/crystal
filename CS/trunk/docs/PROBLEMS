Known platform specific bugs and problems
-----------------------------------------

These problems are both relevant for compiling and running.
Crystal Space is work in progress. Expect these problems to go away
in the future.


With the exception of MacOS/X Server, OpenStep, and NextStep,
all ports of Crystal Space require an 8-bit, 15-bit, 16-bit, or 
32-bit display to run.  It will NOT work on 24-bit displays.  

DJGPP: If you have gcc 2.8.1 then you must disable optimization
(set OPT=debug in mk/user.mak) before compilation because there seems
to be a bug in the optimizer. You can also download EGCS from
http://goof.com/pcg/ which fixes this problem and also generates a
more efficient executable.

DJGPP: With very old versions of gcc you need to disable the assembler
routines (set DO_ASM=no in mk/user.mak) because the assembler doesn't
understand some of the MMX routines. You should upgrade to a more recent
version of DJGPP if possible.

OpenGL: If your OpenGL display looks really bad (bad quality of lighting
compared to the software renderer) then you have a card which doesn't
support the desired blending mode 2*SRC*DST that CS uses. You can edit
opengl.cfg and change the LIGHTMAP_MODE option to 'multiply' (which all
cards should understand) or any of the other values. 'multiply' will
make everything dark but at least it will look right. The RIVA 128ZX
is an example of a card which doesn't support 2*SRC*DST.

Direct3D: The Direct3D port suffers from the same bug as the OpenGL
port with the lightmaps not correctly applied on some 3D cards.


5. Command-Line Arguments And The Config File
---------------------------------------------

Crystal Space supports a number of command-line options. With
'-help' you get a list and a description (including the default
that is used for that option). The default for every command-line
option is set internally in the program unless there is a
corresponding line for it in the config file. For example,
normally the default for -cache is 4000000 (the default size
of the texture cache). But when CACHE=2000000 is set in 'cryst.cfg'
the default will be 2000000. Using an option on the command-line will
always override the default.

The configuration file ('cryst.cfg') is useful for keeping options that
you use often. Not all options can be set with the configuration file
though, and not all configuration file options have a corresponding
command-line option. See docs/config.txt for a complete list of all
configuration file options.


6. The Console
--------------

Starting with version 0.06 there is also an input/output console that
you can use. Press 'tab' to toggle between the console and normal output.
There are several commands that you can use. Type 'help' to get the
list of commands. There is a document docs/console.txt describing
all these commands.
