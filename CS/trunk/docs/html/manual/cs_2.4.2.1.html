<h4 class="subsubsection"> 2.4.2.1 Microsoft Visual C++ 6 </h4>


<p><em>Philip Wyett <a href="mailto:philipwyett@dsl.pipex.com">philipwyett@dsl.pipex.com</a>.</em>

<em>Last updated 3 May 2004.</em>
</p>
<p>In order to successfully compile the Crystal Space 3D Software Development
Kit (<small>SDK</small>), you will need a copy of <em>Microsoft Developer Studio 6</em>
or the stand alone version of <em>Microsoft Visual C++ 6</em>, with additionally
Service Pack (<small>SP</small>) 5 installed.
</p>
<a name="SEC34"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Getting Extra Help </h4>

<p>If you need help with Crystal Space and Visual C++ or just Crystal Space in
general.  You can subscribe and then post a message to the Crystal Space
mailing list.  To subscribe see the following site and fill in the form:
</p>
<p><a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/crystal-main">http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/crystal-main</a>
</p>
<a name="SEC35"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Required/Optional External Libraries and Software </h4>

<p>All the following libraries and Software Development Kits (<small>SDK</small>) unless
stated are not required.  However, if you choose not to install them, at
compile time you must follow the documented instructions of how to unload these
projects from the Crystal Space build process.
</p>
<a name="SEC36"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> cs-win32libs - Required </h4>

<p>Before you attempt to compile Crystal Space, you must download
and install the &quot;cs-win32libs&quot; archive.  This archive contains alot of the
third party header, pre-built libraries and dll files used by Crystal
Space, i.e. <tt>`libz-cs.dll'</tt>, <tt>`libjpeg-cs.dll'</tt>, <tt>`libpng-cs.dll'</tt>, 
etc. See <a href="cs_2.3.html#cs_002dwin32libs">cs-win32libs</a>.
</p>
<p>Once you have downloaded the cs-win32libs package, execute the binary and
follow the setup instructions.  You may want to select &quot;VC typical&quot; in the
&quot;Select Components&quot; screen. You can further adjust the selection of installed 
components depending on your actual set up (e.g. install MinGW-related 
components if you plan to also use CrystalSpace with MinGW/MSYS).
</p>
<a name="SEC37"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> DirectX - Optional </h4>

<p>In order to compile Crystal Space at its minimum i.e. the software renderer,
you must have at least some form of the DirectX Software Development Kit 
(<small>SDK</small>) on your system. 
</p>
<p>Visual C++ 6 comes with the minimum DirectX <small>SDK</small> 5 files required in-order 
to build Crystal Space. 
</p>
<p>The &quot;cs-win32libs&quot; package also come with minimum headers and libraries that 
suffice to compile the parts of Crystal Space that utilize DirectX. The version 
included in cs-win32libs is DirectX 7.
</p>
<p>You can optionally use the latest DirectX Software Development Kit (<small>SDK</small>), 
which can be obtained from:
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/directx">http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/directx</a>
</p>
<p>Thanks, to the miracle which is Microsoft.  If you download and install the
latest DirectX  Software Development Kit (<small>SDK</small>) and already have Visual
C++ installed, it will ask you if you wish to add the paths to the <small>SDK</small> to
Visual C++ so it can use it.  We recommend you accept when offered this option.
If it is not the latest <small>SDK</small> you install you will have to manually point
Visual C++ to where you installed the <small>SDK</small> in-order for it to be used.
This can be done from the Visual C++ file menu and selecting
<em>Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Directories</em>.  You must add the paths for both the
include files and libraries and being that we wish Visual C++ to see and use
this new <small>SDK</small> before all possible others on your system, you must click on
and drag both paths you have entered to the top of the list.
</p>
<a name="SEC38"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Python - Optional </h4>

<p>Crystal Space contains support for Python scripting and thus has projects
within it requires that Python be installed on your system.  Make sure you add
the Python <em>include</em> and <em>libs</em> directories to <small>MSVC</small> so that the
compiler can see those files.  If you wish to compile with Python support you
must install Python 2.2 or later, which can be obtained from:
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</a>
</p>
<a name="SEC39"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Compiling Crystal Space </h4>

<p>To compile Crystal Space, you'll have to perform the following steps.  If
anything doesn't work, see the Win32 <small>FAQ</small>, <a href="#MSVC6-FAQ">MSVC6 FAQ</a>.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Load <tt>`CS\mk\msvc\wkstypical.dsw'</tt>.

</li><li>
Remove all projects you don't want to compile.  To do this, right-click on the
project in the list and select <em>Unload Project</em>.  Examples of a project
which you don't want to compile might include <tt>`plgcspython'</tt> if you do not 
have the Python <small>SDK</small> installed.

</li><li>
Make <samp>`grpall-typical'</samp> your active project.  This is done by right clicking
on it and then clicking on <em>Set as Active Project</em>.

</li><li>
From the file menu select <em>Build-&gt;Rebuild All</em> or alternatively hit your
<kbd><kbd>F7</kbd></kbd> key.  <em>Note</em>: If you want to build a debuggable version of
Crystal Space, you should select the <em>Debug</em> build mode; otherwise select
the <em>Release</em> build mode.  Do not use the special-purpose
<em>ExtensiveMemDebug</em> build mode.

</li><li>
After a while the compilation should finish without error.  The signal for a
successful build will be come in the form of the something similar to the
following:

<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">-------- Configuration: grpall-typical - Win32 Debug --------

grpall-typical.lib - 0 error(s), 0 warning(s)
</pre></td></tr></table></li></ol>

<a name="SEC40"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Running the Demonstration Applications </h4>

<p>The first app you should try is Walktest.  This program shows many of the
features of the 3D engine.  You can run it by starting it from the windows
explorer.  It should be at <tt>`.../cs/walktest.exe'</tt>.  Don't start it from
other locations or from within Visual Studio.  It won't find the required files
if you do.
</p>
<p>If you want to run a debug session, you first have to set the working
directory.  Open <em>Project/Settings</em>, select the appWalktest project,
switch to the <em>Debug</em> tab and enter the base <tt>`CS\'</tt> directory as the
working directory for debug sessions (for example, <tt>`C:\CS\'</tt>).  Be sure to
to this for <em>Debug</em> and <em>Release</em> builds.
</p>
<p>You can now continue with the next platform-independent step.  The remaining
Windows-specific sections are only important when you want to compile your own
application using Crystal Space.
</p>
<a name="SEC41"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Structure of the Workspace </h4>

<p><em>Note</em>: If you find bugs in the <small>MSVC</small> project or workspace files
coming with Crystal Space, do not send a patch for the project files to the
developers.  These files are generated automatically, so your fixes would be
useless.  Instead, send a description of the bug to the mailing list.
</p>
<p>The Crystal Space workspace is divided into several projects.  They all exist
as separate project files (<tt>`*.dsp'</tt>).  The projects are collected together
by workspaces <tt>`*.dsw'</tt>.  A workspace will also ensure correct linking
between the various projects.  There are several workspaces to choose from.
Most users should choose the <em>typical</em> workspace, but the others are
available for the adventurous.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<tt>`wkstypical.dsw'</tt> -- Builds the typical modules needed by most users of
Crystal Space.

</li></ul>

<p>The workspace uses a prefix system for naming contained projects:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<tt>`app'</tt> -- Prefixes application projects.
</li><li>
<tt>`lib'</tt> -- Prefixes library projects.
</li><li>
<tt>`plg'</tt> -- Prefixes plugin module projects.
</li><li>
<tt>`grp'</tt> -- Prefixes psuedo-groups of related projects.
</li></ul>

<p>The <em>Libraries</em> are C++ libraries that you can link into your own
programs.  Some of these libraries are part of the core of Crystal Space.  You
can find more information about this in <a href="cs_6.html#SEC350">Facilities</a>.  Their output are
<tt>`.lib'</tt> files.
</p>
<p>The <em>Plugins</em> are also programming libraries, but they use a special
mechanism called <small>SCF</small> as their interface to your program.  This separates
their interface from the internals of the library and thus allows dynamic
linking.  In fact, some of the <em>Libraries</em> also use <small>SCF</small>.  The rule
for the <small>MSVC</small> workspace is simple: The <em>Plugins</em> are projects that
build a dynamic library (<tt>`.dll'</tt>).  You can find more information in the
section of this manual dealing with plug-in modules.  See section <a href="cs_7.html#SEC371">Plug-In Modules and Drivers</a>.
</p>
<p>The <em>Applications</em> are programs using some of these libraries, so they
produce <tt>`.exe'</tt> files.

<h4 class="subsubheading"> Compiling Your Own Program Using Crystal Space </h4>

<p>There is a <small>HOWTO</small> which explains how to create an <small>MSVC6</small> project file
for your own program which utilizes Crystal Space.
See section <a href="cs_5.8.16.html#SEC288">Creating an External <small>MSVC</small> 6 Application</a>.
</p>
<a name="SEC43"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Frequently Asked Questions (<small>FAQ</small>) </h4>
<p><a name="MSVC6-FAQ"></a>
</p>
<p>This is the list of frequently asked questions for the Win32 port of Crystal
Space.  Please consult this list if you are having difficulty building or using
the project.
</p>
<a name="SEC44"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Compilation </h4>

<ul>
<li> 
Q. <em>I get &quot;Errors in post link&quot; and later &quot;file not found&quot; errors.</em>

<p>A. Some problems with non-latin directory names have been reported (e.g.
Hebrew).  If your <tt>`CS'</tt> directory is under such a directory, try to move it
to a directory which name has only Latin characters in it.
</p>
</li><li>
Q. <em>I get errors like the following:</em>

<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">plugins\video\canvas\ddraw8\i_g2d.h(14) : error C2061:
  syntax error : identifier 'LPDIRECTDRAW7'
plugins\video\canvas\ddraw8\i_g2d.h(16) : error C2061:
  syntax error : identifier 'LPDIRECTDRAWSURFACE7'
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>A. You are not using the DirectX <small>SDK</small> 8 or higher. Either you have not
installed the correct DirectX <small>SDK</small>, or you haven't told <small>MSVC</small> to use
it instead of the older <small>SDK</small> included with <small>MSVC</small>. Either install the
<small>SDK</small> correctly or unload the DirectX 8 related projects.
</p>
</li><li>
Q. <em>Where are the <tt>`zlib.h'</tt>, <tt>`png.h'</tt> and <tt>`jpeglib.h'</tt> files?</em>

<p>A. Those files are not part of the Crystal Space project, but they are
required to build it.  You must get a version of the following packages, most
of which can be easily found on the Internet.  You can download precompiled
versions of these libraries i.e. <em>cs-win32libs</em> or grab the source code and
compile it yourself if you prefer.  See section <a href="cs_2.3.html#SEC19">External Libraries</a>.
</p>
<p>The resources from these packages should be placed in the following locations.
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">CS\libjpeg.dll
CS\libpng.dll
CS\libz.dll
CS\include\csutil\win32\jconfig.h
CS\include\csutil\win32\jerror.h
CS\include\csutil\win32\jinclude.h
CS\include\csutil\win32\jmorecfg.h
CS\include\csutil\win32\jpeglib.h
CS\include\csutil\win32\png.h
CS\include\csutil\win32\pngconf.h
CS\include\csutil\win32\zconf.h
CS\include\csutil\win32\zlib.h
CS\libs\csutil\win32\libs\zlib.lib
CS\libs\csutil\win32\libs\png.lib
CS\libs\csutil\win32\libs\libjpeg.lib
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Note that the source code package generally already contains the files from the
<tt>`include'</tt> and <tt>`libs'</tt> directories, so you may not have to bother with
them.  The <small>CVS</small> repository contains these files as well.
</p>
</li><li>
Q. <em>How can I reduce build times?</em>

<p>A. Build only the projects you will need. You must build all the Crystal Space
libraries, however those you may not need can be unloaded (Right click on the
project you wish unload from the build process and click on Unload). <em>Be
very careful when unloading projects as some of Crystal Spaces projects e.g.
some plugins are dependent on others</em>.
</p>
</li><li>
Q. <em>How can I reduce build sizes?</em>
A. Build only the projects you will need.
A. Turning off precompiled headers tends to save a large amount of file space
while increasing build times somewhat.
</li></ul>

<a name="SEC45"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Linking </h4>

<ul>
<li>
Q. <em>Where are the files <tt>`png.lib'</tt> and <tt>`zlib.lib'</tt>?</em>

<p>A. Just look above at the question about <tt>`zlib.h'</tt> and <tt>`png.h'</tt>.
It's the same problem, and if you have already done what is explained there,
I can't do much for you!
</p>
</li><li>
Q. <em>I've got unresolved symbols.</em>

<p>A. What kind of symbols?
</p>
<ul class="toc">
<li>-
<samp>`_png_<small class="dots">...</small>'</samp>: That means that you don't link the project with
<tt>`png.lib'</tt>.  Just take a look below where it is explained how to do so.

</li><li>-
<samp>`_inflate<small class="dots">...</small>'</samp> and <samp>`_deflate<small class="dots">...</small>'</samp>: Well, it seems to your
project lacks <tt>`zlib.lib'</tt>.  The trick is explained just below, so hang on.

</li><li>-
<samp>`_DirectDraw<small class="dots">...</small>'</samp>: Same as above, but for <tt>`ddraw.lib'</tt> (DirectX
component), look below.

</li><li>-
Any others: Well, I always have a solution, but this one is more difficult.  It
seems that there is a missing source file in your project.  But the question
is, which source file?  If it isn't obvious by the name of the functions, just
to the following: In the menu <em>Edit</em>, select the option <em>Find in
Files<small class="dots">...</small></em>.  Put the name of the function in the field &quot;Find What&quot;, check
that the &quot;In Folder&quot; field content is the Crystal Space source directory and
press <em>Find</em>.  You should get a bunch of files, many of them just making a
call to the function.  But there is surely one which contains the definition of
the function.  Look at the position of the file where it is defined, and add it
to the project (menu <em>Project/Add To Project/Files</em>).

<p>In order to add (or remove) a library for the link process, invoke the
<em>Project/Settings/Link</em> menu item, then select the &quot;General&quot; category
tab..  There is a field called &quot;Object/Library Modules&quot; that lists all the
libraries added to the project at link time.
</p></li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>OK, now it should link.  So you should have an executable file called
<tt>`walktest.exe'</tt> in your src directory.  Let's run it!
</p>
<a name="SEC46"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Executing </h4>

<ul>
<li>
Q. <em>I just get a black screen.</em>

<p>A. When I start <tt>`walktest'</tt> I just get a black screen, maybe with some
text output, but after a few seconds it drops back to the normal windows
screen without an error.
</p>
<p>This shouldn't happen any more, because in most cases now, <tt>`walktest'</tt> will
display proper error messages.  Anyway, you should make sure you have set an
appropriate directory set (see above).  Make sure you have specified the map
file in <tt>`walktest.cfg'</tt> as <samp>`Walktest.Settings.WorldFile='</samp> (also keep
in mind, that your current directory is, where the executable sits.)
</p>
</li><li>
Q. <em>I get the following (or similar) errors:</em>

<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">WARNING: could not load plugin
  `crystalspace.graphics3d.software'
WARNING: failed to initialize plugin
  `crystalspace.engine.3d'
FATAL: No iGraphics3D plug-in loaded!
FATAL: No iGraphics2D plug-in loaded!
Error initializing system!
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>A. You probably did not compile everything. Compiling only the <tt>`.exe'</tt>
file is not sufficient!  You must also compile all plug-ins you want to use.
In the above example the software renderer is missing.
</p>
<p>If you are certain that everything is compiled, make sure your working
directory is set to <tt>`CS\'</tt>.  To do this go to the <em>Project</em> menu.
Select <em>Settings</em> and go to the <em>Debug</em> tab.  Change the debug
executable to <tt>`X:\CS\appname'</tt> where <tt>`X:'</tt> is the drive letter where
the Crystal Space project is installed.  Next set the working directory to
<tt>`X:\CS'</tt>.  Click <small>OK</small> and you should be all set.
</p>
<p>If after doing this, you are still getting the same error, make sure that you 
have the <tt>`zlib.dll'</tt> installed, the <small>VFS</small> plugin is dependent upon it.
</p></li></ul>

<a name="SEC47"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Blasting the Past </h4>

<p>If you have previously used the long-deprecated and ancient <tt>`msvc_libs'</tt>
package, it's recommended you remove it before installing the
<tt>`cs-win32libs'</tt> package as outlined above.  Unfortunately, the
<tt>`msvc_libs'</tt> package was a simple <small>ZIP</small> file with no means of
uninstalling whatsoever. However, the header and library files were located in
the <tt>`include\cssys\win32'</tt> and <tt>`libs\cssys\win32\cssys'</tt> directories,
but as the <code>cssys</code> library has been merged into <code>csutil</code>, Crystal
Space's files in those directories has been relocated as well, so you can
safely remove these directories.
</p>
<p>However, the <tt>`msvc_libs'</tt> package also contained a couple of <small>DLL</small> 
files, copied to the <tt>`CS\'</tt> root directory.  To remove them, use the
following batch file that removes all <small>DLL</small> files contained in the different
versions of the <tt>`msvc_libs'</tt> package:

<h4 class="subsubheading"> Miscellaneous </h4>

<ul>
<li>
Q. <em>My last update did compile, but now I got a new version from the
<small>CVS</small> repository and everything seems to be broken.</em>

<p>A. When working with Crystal Space, always keep in mind, that this is a
multiplatform project.  So sometimes not all features will work correct on all
platforms.  Sometimes a specific port may even be broken due to changes in
other ports.  Since the introduction of <small>CVS</small> (see <a href="cs_1.6.html#CVS">CVS</a>) this is usually
only for a short time, so if you got your version out of <small>CVS</small>, it usually
pays off, to post a message describing the problems to the Crystal Space
Mailing List describing you problem and include the exact error messages.  If
you wait a while, this will probably be fixed, or at least be worked around.
See section <a href="cs_1.7.html#SEC10">Mailing Lists</a>.
</p>
</li><li>
Q. <em>I have a problem that you haven't solved here!</em>

<p>A. Try sending a note to the Crystal Space mailing list and asking your
question there.  See section <a href="cs_1.7.html#SEC10">Mailing Lists</a>.  Be sure to include any pertinent
information, such as the operating system you are using, the compiler, which
version of Crystal Space, and any special configuration information.
