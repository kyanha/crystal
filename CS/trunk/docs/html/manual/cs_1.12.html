</P><P>

<LI>
Denis Dmitriev (<A HREF="mailto:mrsigma@home.com">mrsigma@home.com</A>)
<P>

Denis contributed a routine to split a convex object into slices parallel to
the view plane (useful for volumetric fog).  He added a progress bar to the
console (during lighting) and added a new way to do bilinear filtering for the
software renderer.  He also dramatically improved the quality of the
precalculated lightmaps in the software renderer.  Denis improved the movement
system in WalkTest by implementing gravity and better collision detection
(using the collision detection system from Alex Pfaffe).  He added the
(defunct) metademo application which was later reworked to become the
`<TT>metaballs</TT>' mesh object.  He also fixed a number of bugs.
</P><P>

<LI>
Eric Sunshine (<A HREF="mailto:sunshine@sunshineco.com">sunshine@sunshineco.com</A>)
<P>

Eric is one of the developers who does far more work than can possibly be
detailed in this small blurb, and his contribution to Crystal Space is far
more extensive than this tiny entry implies. His contributions include:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
Ported Crystal Space to MacOS/X, MacOS/X Server (Rhapsody), OpenStep, and
NextStep.
<P>

<LI>
Is the designer, instigator, and (often) implementor of many of the sweeping
architectural changes to the project which have taken it from a monolithic and
inflexible Quake-<EM>wannabe</EM> to a well-designed, and well-thought-out,
modular, and extensible package aimed at a much wider audience. A small list of
such sweeping changes includes: Replacement of the monolithic SCF
registration database (`<TT>scf.cfg</TT>') with a self-describing plugin facility;
eradication of the monolithic "system driver" class and related convolutioin
which prevented Crystal Space from acting as a component capable of being
<EM>plugged into</EM> a larger, existing application framework; creation of the
domain-based configuration facility which allows higher-priority components to
override settings of lower-priority components, and which maintains
user-specific settings separately from factory-supplied (read-only) settings
(the user-specific settings can roam with the user if supported by the
platform); the "object registry", which is a general-purpose container
accessible to all components, and into which components can place any resources
they wish to share with other components; instigation of the event system
overhaul to take it from a monolithic, unalterable facility to a completely
extensible one in which any plugin module or custom application can define and
create new event types dynamically (without having to modify the Crystal Space
event definitions); and much more.
<P>

<LI>
Fixed hordes upon hordes of bugs and problems throughout the project.
<P>

<LI>
Provided significant updates and clean up to the build systems, source code,
organization, and architecture.
<P>

<LI>
Added an automated synthesis process for the Windows/MSVC project files.
This process gleans necessary information from the GNU makefiles
throughout the project in order to entirely eliminate manual maintenance of
these files.
<P>

<LI>
Added automated generation of CVS "snapshots". These are packages
(archive files) containing the complete CVS tree. Also, log files and
<EM>diff</EM> files are generated.
<P>

<LI>
Took on the task of acting as master editor of the Crystal Space documentation.
As part of this job, he has written much of the content which ties together
various portions of the manual, fleshed out much of the bare skeleton and
written many otherwise absent sections. He is also responsible for the
documentation's current look and feel and has created an entire supporting
infrastructure to make documentation available easily and automatically on all
supported platforms. He set up the automated API reference generation,
node repairing for the Texinfo documentation source, and conversion of Texinfo
to various other formats.  He has also pored through the documentation and
updated many out of date references.
<P>

<LI>
Re-wrote and re-engineered the (now defunct) BeOS port of Crystal Space almost
entirely from scratch, in the process making it about 98% functional as
compared to being only about 15% functional before the re-write.
<P>

<LI>
Re-engineered Crystal Space's network driver architecture and completely
rewrote the network drivers from scratch.  The new architecture is far more
robust, generalized, and usable than the old.
<P>

<LI>
Coerced Crystal Space to use GNU Autoconf for configuration (or, looked at
another way, he coerced Autoconf to work with Crystal Space), and wrote all of
the underlying configuration support code (no small job).
</UL>
<P>

<LI>
Eric Wigforss (<A HREF="mailto:ewigforss@novametrix.com">ewigforss@novametrix.com</A>)
<P>

Eric applied a few Windows-specific patches to the networking code.
</P><P>

<LI>
Erik Namtvedt
<P>

Erik contributed the (now defunct) ensocket network plugin.
</P><P>

<LI>
FragDance Galore (<A HREF="mailto:fragdance@hotmail.com">fragdance@hotmail.com</A>)
<P>

FragDance contributed a WAL/SGI loader, and added initial support for
alpha maps to the texture loaders. He also contributed to the halo code.
</P><P>

<LI>
Frank O'Connor (<A HREF="mailto:frank@oconnors.org">frank@oconnors.org</A>)
<P>

Frank maintained the Windows port of Crystal Space for a while.  One of the
first tasks he undertook was a reorganization of the MSVC project
files. He also helped with project maintenance in general.
</P><P>

<LI>
Frank Richter (<A HREF="mailto:resqu@gmx.ch">resqu@gmx.ch</A>)
<P>

Frank has done too much to mention.  He has worked a great deal on many parts
of the project, making from minor to large-scale changes, ranging from the
build system, to the plugin system, to the renderer, to the engine.  He has
done a lot of work on the new renderer architecture, and has been a driving
force in improving localization and internationalization support.
</P><P>

<LI>
Fritz Elfert (<A HREF="mailto:fritz.elfert@millenux.com">fritz.elfert@millenux.com</A>)
<P>

Fritz fixed some bugs in sprcal3d, map2cs, null renderer, VFS,
`<SAMP>csStringArray</SAMP>', etc.
</P><P>

<LI>
Gary Clark (<A HREF="mailto:GaryC@jeld-wen.com">GaryC@jeld-wen.com</A>)
<P>

Gary designed the basic framework of the `<SAMP>Graphics3D</SAMP>' class (which later
became `<SAMP>csGraphics3D</SAMP>', and which later spawned the `<SAMP>iGraphics3D</SAMP>'
interface).  Gary also made an extension to optionally allow the use of
accurate RGB light sourcing in the software renderer. (It is optional
because it slows the texture cache.)  He also supplied a patch to fix the
problem with the X11 driver where it would not start drawing until an expose
event was generated.  He contributed the `<TT>lin_joy.cpp</TT>' file, which
provided an example of how to use the joystick from within Linux. (This was
never integrated into the project, however Norman Kraemer much later provided a
Linux joystick plugin which is part of the project.)
</P><P>

<LI>
Gary Haussmann (<A HREF="mailto:g.haussmann@worldnet.att.net">g.haussmann@worldnet.att.net</A>)
<P>

Gary wrote the original OpenGL renderer, as well as the early importers for
3DS and `<TT>.md2</TT>' models.
</P><P>

<LI>
George Yohng (<A HREF="mailto:cspace@mmts.nsys.by">cspace@mmts.nsys.by</A>)

</P><P>

<LI>
Gert Steenssens (<A HREF="mailto:gsteenss@eps.agfa.be">gsteenss@eps.agfa.be</A>)
<P>

Gert wrote the Linux drivers for the sound system and also converted the
SVGALIB driver to COM (way back when COM was used in the
project.  He also helped develop the Linux/Glide and OpenGL ports.
</P><P>

<LI>
Greg Ewing (<A HREF="mailto:greg@cosc.canterbury.ac.nz">greg@cosc.canterbury.ac.nz</A>)
<P>

use the <CODE>csPath</CODE> class to smoothly move an object along some path.
</P><P>

<LI>
Helge Foerster (<A HREF="mailto:Helge.Foerster@t-online.de">Helge.Foerster@t-online.de</A>)

<P>

Ivan cleaned up the matrix/vector code and rewrote the `<SAMP>csCamera</SAMP>' class.
He also helped a lot with cleaning up the perspective projection and clipping,
in which he made some considerable improvements.  He also helped fix a lot of
bugs with portals and clipping.  Ivan also enhanced the image loader classes to
make it possible to dynamically add new image formats even with a pre-compiled
Crystal Space library.  He re-wrote the map loader routines and added the
`<SAMP>csObject</SAMP>' library.  He also separated the very early scripting support
from the engine.
