Here are a few notes on installing Crystal Space on SGI/IRIX:

 - there still may be a problem with redefinition of BOOL.  As a quick
     fix, change definition of BOOL from unsigned long to unsinged
     char.

 - don't forget to change USE_MESA=0 in mk/user.mak, in order to take
   advantage of hardware OpenGL acceleration.

 - don't forget to set DRIVER to opengl in cryst.cfg


Enjoy!
