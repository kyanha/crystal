History starts at first public release. The history order has been
reversed so that new features are at the top.

Short-term cleanups that need to be done:
	- Resolve config/console/commandline mess.  Several things are broken
	  currently: gamma, dmipmap1, ...
	- Add to API: absolute versions of Rotate and RotateWorld for csCamera.
	- Resolve confusion with SetTexture() and SetTextureHandle().  We need
	  to be consequent.
	- Consider flattening many of the routines that are now structured to
	  go through all the recursive object layers (csWorld, csSector,
	  csThing, ...)
	- Check the dependencies of libraries/COM objects and try to find
	  includes that don't belong there (like from csengine).

4-Jan-2000
	- Improved style a bit in new planeclp.h.
	- Started work on including curved surfaces to the visibility
	  algorithms. This initially means that csThing::Merge() now
	  actually also merges curved surfaces.
	- Changed STATBSP() option so that it ignores things that
	  contains curves and doesn't try to add them to the static bsp.
	  This means that curved surfaces will now appear correctly
	  even if you use STATBSP() but they will still not use the
	  visibility algorithm (i.e. they will be slow).
	- Thomas Hieber removed setting for manual sectoring in map2cs.
	  It is now always on. Textures are also exported with different
	  name and filename.
	- Thomas also fixed the release mode name for the Windows OpenGL
	  2D driver.
3-Jan-2000
	- Some changes to python scripts from Eric Sunshine.
	- Thomas Hieber fixed a few things to make CS compilable again with
	  MSVC.
	- Norman Kramer added new keywords to world format TEX_SET and
	  TEX_SET_SELECT. Using these new keywords it is possible to use
	  different texture sets for different instantiations of a thing
	  template.
2-Jan-2000
	- Removed another 16 bytes from csLightMap. This change also
	  makes dynamic lighting more efficient (slightly).
	- Started cleaning up csPolyTexture.
	- Optimization in the software renderer (CreateDirtyMatrix).
	- VERY significant memory optimization. Instead of storing four
	  lightmap structures (and lightmaps) for every polygon we now only
	  store one. The four lightmaps were the same anyway. I don't know
	  why there should be four. This is left-over from a long time ago.
	  This optimization means we save 4800 bytes for every lightmapped
	  polygon with a 16x16 lightmap.
	- Changes to Map2CS from Thomas Hieber (new lightscale option).
	- Norman Kramer added a farplane to csCamera object such that
	  everything is clipped to that plane. Default is no clipping.
1-Jan-2000
	- My computer is still working :-)
	  And so is Crystal Space.
	- Removed 16 bytes from every csLightMap. This means a saving
	  of 64 bytes for every lightmapped polygon since there are four
	  lightmaps for the four mipmap levels.
	- Removed another 12 bytes from csLightMap.
	- Small optimization in coverage mask tree.
	- Seth Galbraith did some changes on map2cs so that textures
	  with no data are not saved. If no texture is found then a new
	  texture is created (with no data) with the name from the map
	  file.
	- Seth also updated DJGPP help system with some correct links.
