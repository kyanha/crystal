The history order has been reversed so that new features are at the top.

Short-term cleanups that need to be done:
	- Resolve config/console/commandline mess.  Several things are broken
	  currently: gamma, dmipmap1, ...
	- Add to API: absolute versions of Rotate and RotateWorld for csCamera.
	- Resolve confusion with SetTexture() and SetTextureHandle().  We need
	  to be consequent.
	- Consider flattening many of the routines that are now structured to
	  go through all the recursive object layers (csWorld, csSector,
	  csThing, ...)
	- Check the dependencies of libraries/COM objects and try to find
	  includes that don't belong there (like from csengine).

12-Jan-2000
	- Added double linked list code from David Durant to csutil.
11-Jan-2000
	- Changes from David Durant to implement a new callback for sprites
	  which is called when the sprite is REALLY drawn. He also added
	  an actor pointer (csObject) to csSprite3D.
	- Andrew Zabolotny added -f option to awk debug script so that it
	  can be invoked manually.
	- Some corrections to INSTALL.Win for SCF.
	- Norman Kramer fixed rle8 encoding and added little/big endian
	  support in bmp loader class.
10-Jan-2000
	- Andrew Zabolotny has CVS write access again! :-)
	- He also fixed the change that Jorrit made with regards
	  to SetName in csObject.
	- Norman Kramer removed the test for important colors in 256-color
	  bitmaps (BMP loading).
	- More updates to Map2CS from Thomas Hieber.
          The default sector is now generated using black flatshading
	  instead of using an randomly selected texture. (this will
	  also help a little bit with performance).
	- Thomas also updated the Win VC project files to reflect Jorrits
	  latest move of files.
	- Eric Sunshine did a few changes to NeXT documentation.
	- Norman Kramer added support for RLE8 encoded BMP-files.
8-Jan-2000
	- Michael Dale Long added support for configurable colors using
	  the iTextureManager to iConsole.  He also removed all dependencies
	  on the 3D graphics driver from the csConsole plugin.
	- Eric Sunshine changed the CVS snapshot script so that it also
	  creates a symbolic link to the most recent 'diff' file in addition
	  to creating a link to the most recent package.  (This feature was
	  requested by a user.)
	- Fixed bug in the destructor of csPolygon3D. After freeing some
	  of the internal resources functions were called that still dependent
	  on those resources. Solved this by setting the pointer to the
	  resources to NULL so that those functions can detect that case.
	  This fixes the bug when CS is exited while a dynamic light
	  is active.
	- Moved all 2D cullers to libs/csengine/culler (coverage mask
	  tree, quadtree, and c-buffer).
	- Also moved quadtree.cpp from csgeom to csengine/culler.
	- Created new csengine/polytree and moved BSP and octree stuff
	  from csgeom to csengine.
	- Thomas Hieber did some changes to Map2CS. Polygons are
	  only added to sector walls that are part of 'worldspawn'.
	  Some other additional fixes and changes.
	- Thomas also added documentation for map2cs.
	- Thomas also fixed a crash on exit related to the console.
	- Michael Ewert did some changes to csphyzik. He added body_a
	  and a 'work in progress' class.
	  Also added get_I_inv and get_angular_P.
7-Jan-2000
	- Fixed colored static lighting for OpenGL and Direct3D.
	- Some fixes on lightmap deallocation. Now use DecRef()
	  consistently. Unfortunatelly this still doesn't seem to fix
	  the 'pure virtual method call' at exit.
	- Michael Dale Long created the new iConsole interface and cscon 
	  plugin.  Modified csSimpleConsole and other code that used it
	  (walktest, csgame) to use it instead of the old csConsole.
	  The new cscon still needs a lot of work, so csSimpleConsole
	  will continue to work as before.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed several minor problems which cropped up with
	  the introduction of the new iConsole and cscon.
	- Robert Bate updated the Macintosh project.
	- Norman Kramer updated documentation for the new world file
	  features he added (TEX_SET, TEX_SET_SELECT).
	- Small fix to new console from Seth Galbraith.
6-Jan-2000
	- Thomas Hieber added iterators for nodes and keys.
	  Added simplified access to keys and node by name and classname.
	  Added "FindName", Added methods with more intuitive names (in
	  csobject library). (The old ones are still there...)
	- Eric Sunshine added Append(char) to csString.  He also added a
	  constructor which accepts a (char).
	- Michael Dale Long fixed several bugs in makefile.py.
5-Jan-2000
	- Some further changes on support for curves in visibility system
	  (unfinished).
	- Eric Sunshine updated some out-of-date information in people.tex
	  and added missing information.
	- Eric Sunshine elmiminated some compilation warnings in world.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine worked around an OpenStep compiler bug which was
	  triggered by the new csengine/planeclp.h file.  The compiler
	  generates unlinkable code when an inline method calls another inline
	  method which the compiler has not seen yet.  A simple textual
	  reorganization of the file fixed the problem.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated signed vs. unsigned comparision compilation
	  warnings in map2cs.
	- Thomas Hieber added support for game sepcific data in the world
	  file (KEY and NODE).
	- Thomas also did a few further changes on Map2CS.
4-Jan-2000
	- Improved style a bit in new planeclp.h.
	- Started work on including curved surfaces to the visibility
	  algorithms.  This initially means that csThing::Merge() now actually
	  also merges curved surfaces.
	- Changed STATBSP() option so that it ignores things that contains
	  curves and doesn't try to add them to the static bsp.  This means
	  that curved surfaces will now appear correctly even if you use
	  STATBSP() but they will still not use the visibility algorithm (i.e.
	  they will be slow).
	- Thomas Hieber removed setting for manual sectoring in map2cs.  It is
	  now always on.  Textures are also exported with different name and
	  filename.
	- Thomas also fixed the release mode name for the Windows OpenGL 2D
	  driver.
	- Eric Sunshine modified the CVS snapshot-generation script to patch
	  the CVS/Root files ("cvs1" --> "cvs.crystal.sourceforge.net") such
	  that the resulting snapshot can be used later for an anonymous cvs
	  update.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed DECLARE_GROWING_ARRAY() so that it is compilable
	  on all platforms.  Recent changes to appease MSVC (the addition of a
	  floating semi-colon) were not grok'd by the NextStep compiler, so the
	  issue was resolved by eliminating the problem altogether. :-)
	- Eric Sunshine applied a patch to blocks.cpp from Artur Biesiadowski
	  <abies@pg.gda.pl> to correct a bug where the orientation of a piece
	  was different on-screen versus in-memory.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed several compilation errors in map2cs.  He also
	  eliminated some compilation warnings.
	- Eric Sunshine removed all of the remaining, obsolete references to
	  csregsvr from the documentation.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the makefile for scftutor so that it once again
	  generates plug-in modules usable by NeXT.
	- Eric Sunshine patched up linking of the CrystalClear plug-in so that
	  it is once again usable on NeXT.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a bug in cctest where it was corrupting the path
	  to the level file (as in "/lev/largelarge").
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a bug in the CrystalClear plug-in where it failed
	  to initialize its embedded physics configuration member.
3-Jan-2000
	- Thomas Hieber fixed a few things to make CS compilable again with
	  MSVC.
	- Norman Kramer added new keywords to world format TEX_SET and
	  TEX_SET_SELECT.  Using these new keywords it is possible to use
	  different texture sets for different instantiations of a thing
	  template.
2-Jan-2000
	- Removed another 16 bytes from csLightMap.  This change also makes
	  dynamic lighting more efficient (slightly).
	- Started cleaning up csPolyTexture.
	- Optimization in the software renderer (CreateDirtyMatrix).
	- VERY significant memory optimization.  Instead of storing four
	  lightmap structures (and lightmaps) for every polygon we now only
	  store one.  The four lightmaps were the same anyway.  I don't know
	  why there should be four.  This is left-over from a long time ago.
	  This optimization means we save 4800 bytes for every lightmapped
	  polygon with a 16x16 lightmap.
	- Changes to Map2CS from Thomas Hieber (new lightscale option).
	- Norman Kramer added a farplane to csCamera object such that
	  everything is clipped to that plane.  Default is no clipping.
	- Eric Sunshine wrote a script (bin/snapshot.py) which generates
	  snapshots and diffs of the CVS repository.  The script currently
	  runs daily and deposits the snapshots at:
	  ftp://crystal.sourceforge.net/pub/crystal/cvs-snapshots.
1-Jan-2000
	- My computer is still working :-)  And so is Crystal Space.
	- Removed 16 bytes from every csLightMap.  This means a saving of 64
	  bytes for every lightmapped polygon since there are four lightmaps
	  for the four mipmap levels.
	- Removed another 12 bytes from csLightMap.
	- Small optimization in coverage mask tree.
	- Seth Galbraith did some changes on map2cs so that textures with no
	  data are not saved.  If no texture is found then a new texture is
	  created (with no data) with the name from the map file.
	- Seth also updated DJGPP help system with some correct links.
