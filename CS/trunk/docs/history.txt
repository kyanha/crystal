The history order has been reversed so that new features are at the top.

8-Feb-2001
	- Changed 'bot' code in Walktest and ptlab to use the new spr3d
	  plugin instead of csSprite3D.
	- Initialization of collision detection in WalkTest will now work
	  for all mesh objects that actually support iPolygonMesh (currently
	  only spr3d plugin does this).
	- Fixed spr3d plugin so that GenerateLOD() and ComputeBoundingBox()
	  will now be called upon the first creation of a sprite instance
	  from a factory. Previously this was not done so this could give
	  problems.
	- Changed csDrawCallback in meshobj.h to use iMeshWrapper and
	  iRenderView instead of csMeshWrapper and csRenderView.
	- Extended iMeshWrapper interface with SetDrawCallback() and
	  GetDrawCallback().
	- Added 'add_meshobj' to walktest which is equivalent to 'add_sprite'.
	- Ported the skeletal tree from WalkTest to use the new spr3d
	  plugin.
	- Added ObjAdd(), ObjRemove(), ObjRelease(), and GetObjectParentI()
	  to iObject SCF interface so that they can be used from within
	  plugins too.
	- Added a new constructor to csCollider which accepts an iObject*
	  as a parent. This will help to attach csCollider objects to
	  mesh object plugins.
	- Fixed bug in csMeshWrapper. It did not use the correct SCF macros
	  to indicate that it was actually getting iBase from the parent
	  csSprite.
	- Fixed a bug in the spr3d plugin where it would reset the value
	  of MixMode to CS_FX_COPY the first time it was used.
7-Feb-2001
	- Martin Geisse removed sound volume division by number of sources
	  from software sound because it did not sound very good.
	- Martin also fixed an old bug with distorted 8-bit software sound.
	- Philip Wyett added missing line: "virtual void NextFrame ();"
	  dec into section 5.2.4 of the Simple tutorial.
	  The fact of this ommission was brought to my attention
	  by Menachem Pastreich - Thanks :-)
	- Philip also fixed a compile error in gamecore with regards to
	  the move of cspixmap.h from csengine to csfx.
	- Wouter Wijngaards added missing CreateInstance routine to
	  csAnimationTemplate.
	- Wouter also ixed another bug: the order of pushes in
	  csAnimationTemplate::AddFrame was wrong. Also fixed the
	  GetLength(). csAnimationTemplate and csAnimatedPixmap
	  work now. (Tested in Tunnel Fighter).
	- Converted the missile in walktest to use the new mesh object
	  spr3d plugin instead of csSprite3D. Also modified standard.zip
	  accordingly.
	- Finished support for spr3dldr (added support for TWEEN and
	  ACTION). Now it can correctly load sprites.
	- Added SCF interface iMeshWrapper which is the SCF version of
	  csMeshWrapper. Also put a few functions in there so that it
	  is possible to actually use it.
	- Added CreateMeshFactory() and CreateMeshObject() conveniance
	  functions to iEngine. The first one creates a factory and the
	  second one will create a mesh object given a factory and place
	  it correctly in the world.
	- Updated simple to use the new conveniance functions.
	- Norman Kramer started optimizing AVI plugin using u/v pipe.
	- Added csLoader::LoadMeshObjectFactory() to load mesh object
	  factories.
	- Simple now uses mesh object system for the sprite too.
6-Feb-2001
	- Continue implementation of spr3d loader plugin. The factory
	  loader should work now.
	- Added support for loading MESHOBJ factories in library files.
	- Also added spr2d and spr2dldr to walkall because the explosion
	  needs it.
	- Eric and Jorrit fixed a bad bug in spr3d which caused the entire
	  system driver to be included in the plugin. Plugins should not
	  link with plugins. But if they do then can only use iSystem and
	  not anything inside cssys (like fatal_exit in this case).
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a couple copy/paste errors in linex2d.mak which
	  were pointed out by Jan Dvorak <johnydog@go.cz>.
	- Martin Geisse did the following changes to cspixmap and
	  csanimation2d:
	    - Moved both from csengine to csfx.
	    - csPixmap is now a more general interface-like class.
	    - csSimplePixmap is now what csPixmap was before.
	    - Changed the animation system to work on a template-instance
	      basis.  Templates are called csAnimationTemplate and instances
	      of a template are called csAnimatedPixmap. These instances
	      inherit from csPixmap.
	    - Animations can now handle frames with different delay values.
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed a bug in csfedit where the mouse would draw
	  on the character when the mouse was not down.
	- Norman Kramer fixed a scaling bug in the AVI plugin.
5-Feb-2001
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a couple compilation warnings in
	  csfedit.cpp.
	- Added GetFOVAngle() to iCamera.
	- Created the spr3d plugin (untested). The old csSprite3D is still
	  there and will remain there until everything is ported to the
	  new plugin. I also still have to implement spr3dldr (the loader).
	- Added spr3d, spr3dldr, explo, and exploldr targets to 'walkall'
	  because these are really required by WalkTest.
	- Started work on spr3dldr (the Sprite3D loader plugin). The
	  plugin currently works but only supports a tiny subset of what
	  needs to be supported (i.e. not enough to be useful).
	- Wouter Wijngaards changed csPixmap to allow subclassing. Made
	  a subclass of csPixmap, that is csAnim2D - an animated pixmap.
	  Each time you draw the correct frame of the animation is
	  substituted, and drawn. Use like a csPixmap, and redraw each frame
	  (if not already a 2d overdraw).
	- Wouter removed the already present csAnimation2D in csengine.
	- Norman Kramer did the following:
	    - Fixed bug in the c yuv2rgba routine: u,v values were taken
	      for 4 sequential pixel, instead the were meant for a 2x2
	      pixelblock.
	    - Started NASM mmx routine for yuv2rgba: doesnt work yet and
	      is not scheduled either.
	- Removed glu.h includes from OpenGL plugins. We don't need it and it
	  adds an unneeded dependency.
4-Feb-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards changed includes, so that make depend works
	  nicer for csfedit.
	- Norman Kramer fixed a bug in the AVI plugin. Red and blue
	  chrominance values were swapped.
3-Feb-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards added full functionality to the .csf font
	  editor. You can edit characters, see a preview, change individual
	  character widths, change font names, widths, save, load, etc.
	- Philip Wyett started integration of DivX into CS tree.
	- Philip also added plggamecore and added "DSP.GCORE.LIBS = xmlparse"
	  to generate correct VC6 project file and fix link errors in
	  the plugin.
2-Feb-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards continued work on csfedit. You can now load
	  a font (or make a new font) and see its contents in a window.
	  The window also has working scrollbars now.
	- Norman Kramer added initialization of pG2D to NULL (for avi plugin).
	- Fixed a compile error in csfedit (only in debug mode) and
	  fixed the makefile so that the description of the make target
	  aligns correctly with the other descriptions.
	- Extended iSkeletonConnectionState with GetTransformation() and
	  SetTransformation().
	- csSprite3D now implements iSprite3DState (similar to the work that
	  has been done yesterday on csSpriteTemplate).
	- Walktest now uses this new iSprite3DState for the skeleton and
	  the ghost.
	- Eric Sunshine enabled generation of MSVC DSP files for the csPython
	  plug-in module and the PySimp application since we have one or two
	  Windows users who would like to build these modules.
	- Martin Geisse fixed two bugs in the sound system.
1-Feb-2001
	- Martin Geisse changed the sockets driver to use system events
	  instead of Open() and Close() methods.
	- Martin also fixed a bug which caused the sound drivers to stop
	  'open', 'close' and 'pre-process' system events from further
	  processing.
	- Norman Kramer set ApplicationShow to SW_SHOWNORMAL in main().
	  For some reason the mingw links main and not WinMain for guio
	  apps. In that case ApplicationShow was initialized to 0 which
	  means HIDE which in turn was the reason the window was invisible
	  when running with opengl/mingw. I remember that it worked before,
	  so probably some linker options slightly changed when linking
	  with mingw - I dont know.
	- Wouter Wijngaards added the csf edit application (font editor).
	  Now it can read files. Note that the csws querydialog for
	  filedialog now only returns full system paths. Not VFS paths.
	  I worked around (prob. unix specific) using stat() and fread().
	- Philip Wyett updated levtool to take account of Andrew's changes
	  yesterday. Move to csTreeBox and changed to new mouse handler
	  csevMouseClick. App now compiles and runs OK again under Windows.
	- Philip also added new avi plugin to autogeneration process. This
	  will generate both the VC6 project files for the plugin and
	  the test application.
	- Added GetAnmIndex() and GetTexIndex() to iSpriteFrame.
	- Added MergeNormals() to iSprite3DFactoryState.
	- Changed csLoader to use the new iSkeletonLimb, iSkeletonConnection,
	  iSkeleton, and iSprite3DFactoryState to load a sprite template.
	  Only partially done though. The impexp loaders still need a pointer
	  to csSpriteTemplate.
	- Fixed QUERY_INTERFACE_SAFE so that it doesn't evaluate it's
	  parameters multiple times.
	- Changed skeletal demos in WalkTest to use the new
	  iSprite3DFactoryState interface (and related).
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a serious bug in cspython.cpp where the contents
	  of several csString objects was potentially being used _after_ the
	  csString was destroyed.  This was one of those object-lifetime
	  issues which differ from compiler to compiler.
31-Jan-2001
	- Martin Geisse fixed a compile-time error in CSWS.
	- Added GetPrivateObject() to iMaterialWrapper.
	- Added QUERY_INTERFACE_SAFE() which will first test if the given
	  object is NULL. In that case it will return NULL. Otherwise
	  equivalent to QUERY_INTERFACE().
	- Let csSpriteTemplate implement iSprite3DFactoryState. This is in
	  preparation of the csSprite3D move to a plugin.
	- Norman Kramer did further work on the video plugins:
	    - Extended PLUGIN var to build AVI and optionally opendivx.
	    - Added output of what is currently done when trying to load video.
	- Philip Wyett altered path to file 'video.avi' to data directory.
	- Andrew Zabolotny did the following changes to CS:
	    - Now the toolbox toolbar tracks the active editor window
	      (model or world) and changes accordingly. I have drawn a few
	      more icons for MazeD in GIMP, and switched the toolbar
	      texture format to truecolor PNG with alpha channel. Now
	      toolbar icons can have (and some already have) semi-transparent
	      parts :-)
	    - CSWS buttons with pictures are grayed (pictures are displayed
	      semi-transparent) when the buttons are disabled. Also they do
	      not emit the cscmdRightButtonClick message when they are
	      disabled (in MazeD this was manifesting as second-level
	      toolbars popping up even from disabled buttons).
	    - Floating hints will disappear properly even if some window
	      has captured the focus (such as a dialog window). To do so
	      they grab the mouse.
	    - Rewrote much of the csTreeCtrl (treeview) control. The
	      basical interface is very similar (except that I've renamed
	      csTreeCtrl into csTreeBox); most of the changes are related
	      to the internal implementation. Other features: a completely
	      new look-and-feel; a extended, more flexible and less
	      cumbersome API (and a simpler implementation). Also I have
	      changed cswstest so that you can switch miscelaneous tree
	      control styles at runtime and see them in effect instantly
	      (like for notebook control).
	    - Made the csLayout class to set the CSS_TRANSPARENT flag
	      (again?) since otherwise the dialog background "under" the
	      layout isn't drawn, and since the layout itself does not paint
	      anything, you get an hall-of-mirrors like effect (when you
	      move the window).
	    - Dialogs with no children will SuggestSize 8x8 rather than
	      2x2 like it did before. This allows for better identification
	      of windows with wrongly set CSWS_TOOLBAR style bit set :-)
	      (toolbar is a dialog too, so if you wrongly set this bit when
	      creating the window, you'll get just a couple of thin black
	      lines which are confusing, at least they were for me :-)
	    - Changed a little the behaviour of csComponent::NextChild()
	      and PrevChild(): now it returns the next/previous *visible*
	      and selectable child rather than just selectable. This has
	      the effect of not showing anymore the hidden windows when
	      closing a visible window (per Jorrit's request). However, if
	      there is nothing left than hidden window, a hidden window
	      will be focused anyway (but not shown).
	    - Changed a little listbox behaviour and look. No lightblue
	      frame on the focused item anymore; when listbox is active,
	      the focused item is denoted by a solid background, otherwise
	      it is denoted with a thin frame of the same color.
	    - Added a method csComponent::OtherToThis (csComponent, x&, y&)
	      which will convert coordinates from coordinate system of
	      other component to this component's coordinate system. This
	      is faster than the using the LocalToGlobal -> GlobalToLocal
	      pair if the `from' component is a child (or grandchild, or
	      grandgrandchild etc) of `this' component.
	    - Made the toolbars resizeable in MazeD. By default toolbars
	      are now four buttons wide (rather than two like it was
	      before), to reserve a little space for coming "world tree"
	      and "material selector" toolbars.
	    - Added a new kind of events: csevMouseClick. This is generated
	      by mouse event manager (AKA mouse driver) when it detects that
	      the mouse button has been pressed and then released within
	      "DoubleClickTime" and the mouse haven't been moved further
	      than "DoubleClickDist". That is, when you quickly press and
	      release the mouse button twice in sequence, you will
	      generate the next events:
		csevMouseDown
		csevMouseUp
		csevMouseClick (at the same time with MouseUp)
		* This event is emmited only if the mouse haven't moved too
		* far between MouseDown and MouseUp and the time between
		* them haven't exceeded some threshold value.
		csevMouseDown
		csevMouseDoubleClick (at the same with MouseDown)
		* This event is also generated if the same conditions are true.
		csevMouseUp
		csevMouseClick (at the same time with MouseUp)
		* Yet another mouse click event, if the conditions are met.
	      You can notice a slight conceptual difference in Click and
	      DoubleClick because Click is generated after mouse is
	      released, and DoubleClick is generated when mouse is pressed.
	      Well, this is so for historical reasons - most GUIs uses
	      mouse this way.
	      ---
	      Also note that the behaviour of double clicks event has
	      slightly changed: now DoubleClick is emmited *in addition*
	      to MouseDown rather than *instead* like it was before. That is,
	      you will *always* get all the MouseDown and MouseUp events
	      disregarding whenever click and doubleclick events have
	      occured; these events are additional and are introduced just
	      to help the programmer to track these conditions; in general
	      he could do it himself by using timer, remembering position etc.
	      ---
	      This has a slight impact on some seldom-encountered code
	      sequences: if before to catch absolutely all mousedown
	      events you had to catch both MouseDown and MouseDoubleClick
	      events, now you have to catch just MouseDown and don't bother
	      about MouseClick and MouseDoubleClick - the event you are
	      looking for will be always emited. In fact, if you will
	      leave the code as before, you will intercept now two
	      events instead of one; while in most cases it doesn't matter,
	      in some cases it can.
	    - Added a small context menu to every toolbar in MazeD.
	    - Started implementing world tree toolbar. Now it is one of the
	      standard toolbars. It displays in a tree fashion the structure
	      of the 3D world. At the "top" level there can be only sectors
	      (AKA rooms), inside them you can nest things and sprites
	      (but not rooms).
	    - Remove ?= from assignment to CSSYS.OBJ since GNU Make 3.77
	      doesn't expand the text after such an assignment. That is,
	      "CSSYS.OBJ ?= $(...)" is treated literally, e.g. the text
	      inside the brackets is not expanded. If someone really needs
	      ?=, use ifndef instead -- although I don't see any assignments
	      to CSSYS.OBJ, so I can't understand why somebody have put ?=
	      there.
	    - Removed "dep: ..." after last line of "clean:" target - it
	      seems like traces of a CVS conflict introduced by someone in CVS.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed cssys.mak to again support conditional setting
	  of OBJ.CSSYS.  (This feature was disabled in the most recent
	  revision).
	- Eric Sunshine fixed video.mak so that the `vid' target only appears
	  in the application list if the platform is also able to build
	  video-related plugins.  Also fixed formatting of help message.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed several compilation problems in MazeD and CSWS.
	  Also resolved some const vs. non-const problems in these modules.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a slew of compilation warnings in cswstest.cpp.
30-Jan-2001
	- Norman Kramer did further work on the video plugins:
	    - Removed some debug code and a stupid comment.
	    - Divx codec works (AVI).
	    - For opengl the pic is flipped vertically , eek (this is because I
	      abused the csImageArea and filled it myself while it was actually
	      meant to be filled by the renderer.  Jorrit talked about
	      introducing a FillPixelArray, which should solve this problem -
	      or the csImageArea can be extended to do that ).
	- Eric Sunshine changed the behavior of the -simdepth option in the
	  AppKit-based Apple/NeXT 2D driver.  If the user specifies an illegal
	  depth, then a suitable warning message is issued and the request is
	  ignored.  Previously, it would return a failure status from
	  iGraphics2D::Initialize() in this circumstance.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed SED_DEPEND in cs.mak so that it works more
	  portably across different versions of GNU make.  In particular, the
	  old definition failed to work correctly on MacOS/X Server 1.0
	  (Rhapsody).
	- Martin Geisse eliminated a few compiler warnings in csgfxldr,
	  glcommon2d.cpp and MazeD.
	- Martin also eliminated a few cases where options have different
	  names in walktest sources and in config file.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed potential a memory leak which Martin introduced
	  in glcommon2d.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed CS/include/cssys/next/csosdefs.h so that it
	  respects SYSDEF_ACCESS.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to jobber.pl:
	    - Now allows user-specification of the temporary working directory
	      (default is "/tmp").
	    - Added a --version option.
29-Jan-2001
	- Martin also modified the sound drivers so that they are now opened,
	  closed, and updated via system events.
	- Brandon Ehle added documentation for the Skeletal Animation format,
	  and the INCLUDESPRITE macro.
	- Philip Wyett added a divide by zero check in csSprite3D.  This fixes
	  ptlab on Windows.
	- Jorrit fixed the fix from Philip Wyett to make it slightly more
	  robust.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a bug in csConfigFile where the SetInt(),
	  SetFloat(), and SetBool() methods would not actually set the key
	  of a newly created node if the value being set was 0, 0.0, or false,
	  respectively.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a bug in csConfigFile where the SetInt(),
	  SetFloat(), and SetBool() methods were applying `delete[]' to the
	  Data value twice.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the project:
	    - Added a makefile (macosx.mak) for MacOS/X.  This makefile is for
	      Apple's new MacOS/X platform using the Cocoa-based Apple/NeXT
	      port.  Since I do not have access to either MacOS/X or recent
	      Macintosh hardware, this makefile is currently untested, but I
	      believe that the project should build cleanly.
	    - Added new menu definition to next.cfg for MacOS/X which respects
	      the new Aqua-style interface.  This differs from the existing
	      menu definition for MacOS/X Server 1.0 (Rhapsody) which is
	      specific to the Platinum-style interface.
	    - Eliminated reliance upon the Objective-C++ compiler for the
	      Apple/NeXT port by reorganizing the code and writing plain-C
	      stubs which interface between the C++ world of Crystal Space and
	      the Objective-C world of the AppKit frameworks of Cocoa,
	      OpenStep, and NextStep.  By eliminating the need for an
	      Objective-C++ compiler, the project can now be built on MacOS/X
	      (which does not ship with an Objective-C++ compiler).  The
	      port-specific .cpp files now contain only pure C++ code.  All of
	      the Objective-C code has been moved to .m files.  (The standard
	      file extension for Objective-C source files is .m.)
	    - Added icursor.h.  This is a pure-C header which contains the
	      csMouseCursorID constants which used to reside in igraph2d.h.
	      Also added ievdefs.h.  This is a pure-C header which contains all
	      of the event-related constants which used to reside in ievent.h.
	      These files are pure-C, rather than C++, because they must be
	      included by the Objective-C source files of the Apple/NeXT port.
	    - Added NeXTDynamicLibrary.cpp, which is the C++ portion of the
	      plugin loading facility for the Apple/NeXT ports.  The existing
	      NeXTLoadLibrary.m is now pure Objective-C and publishes a plain-C
	      interface for use by NeXTDynamicLibrary.
	    - Added NeXTConfigFile which is a plain-C wrapper over the C++
	      Crystal Space configuration facility.
	    - Added rules and support facilities to the Apple/NeXT makefile
	      (next.mak) for recognition and compilation of Objective-C (.m)
	      files.  Also added Objective-C support to next2d.mak.
	    - cssys.mak now sets OBJ.CSSYS conditionally; only if it has not
	      already been set.  This allows the platform-specific makefile to
	      override the list of object files for the system driver.  This
	      facility is used by the Apple/NeXT port to mention Objective-C
	      (.m) object files in OBJ.CSSYS as well as C and C++ files.
	    - cssys.mak now automatically invokes `vpath' for all C files in
	      the system driver source directories (in addition to the `vpath'
	      for C++ files which it has always invoked).
	    - NeXTSystemDriver::SystemExtension() understands the following new
	      messages: "timerfired", "continuelooping", "continuerunning",
	      "dispatchevent", "hidemouse", "showmouse", and "requestshutdown".
	    - De-coupled the tight binding which existed between the
	      AppKit-based NeXT 2D canvas and the NeXT system driver's
	      Objective-C delegate.  Some of the functionality in NeXTDelegate
	      was actually specific to the AppKit-based canvas and may not have
	      been useful or correct for other drivers, such as the planned
	      OpenGL and CoreGraphics drivers.  The following functionality has
	      been moved from NeXTDelegate into the canvas plugin:
		o Setting of "Paused" status message on window when application
		  is suspended.  The canvas now listens for cscmdFocusChanged
		  events to implement this behavior.
		o Creation and management of the window's tracking-rectangle as
		  well as the associated behavior.
		o Window event mask management.
		o Window position adjustment for video optimization.
		o Response to user initiated window-close events.
	      Other functionality which may be useful to any canvas
	      implementation for Apple/NeXT is published by the system driver
	      via iSystem::SystemExtension().  The messages which may be useful
	      to 2D drivers include "dispatchevent", "keydown", "keyup",
	      "mousedown", "mouseup", "mousemoved", "hidemouse", "showmouse",
	      and "requestshutdown".  Furthermore, the canvas no longer
	      communicates directly with the system driver's Objective-C proxy
	      object; nor vice-versa.  All platform-specific communication with
	      the system driver is now accomplished via
	      iSystem::SystemExtension().
	    - The default NeXT 2D canvas plugin no longer includes
	      NeXTDelegate.h from the CS/libs/cssys/next directory.  2D drivers
	      now communicate with the platform-specific library strictly via
	      iSystemDriver::SystemExtension().
	    - The Objective-C application delegate in the Apple/NeXT port now
	      listens for application-activation and application-deactivation
	      notifications in order to suspend and resume the engine rather
	      than relying on window-activation and window-deactivation
	      messages.  Not only is this more sensible, but it also helped to
	      de-couple the AppKit-based 2D canvas from the system driver.
	    - Fixed a simple logic problem in the AppKit-based Apple/NeXT 2D
	      graphics driver where it failed to emit a warning message when
	      the user selected an invalid display depth via the -simdepth
	      option.
	    - The AppKit-based 2D canvas for the Apple/NeXT port no longer
	      relies upon the WindowServer to report its own preferred
	      bit-depth.  It turns out (so I discovered) that this is an
	      unreliable operation on OpenStep since the WindowServer will
	      actually report a different value the very first time the program
	      is run versus subsequent runs.  Instead, the driver now relies
	      upon the preferred depth as reported by the NSWindow or Window
	      class.
	    - Mouse tracking in the canvas' window is now more accurate when
	      user switches away from the window or application and then
	      returns.  In particular, the driver now pays attention to the
	      mouse's location at the time that it once again begins tracking
	      the mouse.
	    - Fixed a problem with the AppKit-based Apple/NeXT 2D driver.  If
	      the mouse was hidden prior to the application being paused, it
	      would not be re-hidden when the application resumed.
	    - The special CFLAGS needed to build the AppKit-based 2D driver
	      (next2d.mak) are now only applied when explicitly building that
	      driver rather than being applied to all modules.
	    - Added a new `inherit' keyword to the list of keywords understood
	      by NeXTMenu when processing a menu item entry.  This keyword
	      allows a menu item to inherit attributes from some other menu
	      item.  These attributes can then be overridden locally.  This
	      facility is useful, for example, when one menu item definition
	      differs from another only by its title.
	    - Added a copious amount of documentation to next.cfg describing
	      all of the supported configuration options.
	    - Fixed a bug in NeXTMenu on NextStep where it would fail to
	      properly build submenus on account of a mis-constructed submenu
	      key prefix.
	    - Converted NeXTMenu and NeXTConfigFile to work with new
	      csConfigFile and related SCF interfaces rather than the
	      deprecated csIniFile.
	    - Fixed vfs.cfg so that it works with MacOS/X Server again
	      following Andrew's change to the meaning of CS_PLATFORM_NAME.
	    - Fixed the Apple/NeXT system driver and next.cfg so that they once
	      again work following andrew's change to the meaning of
	      CS_PLATFORM_NAME.  More importantly, re-added the
	      OS_NEXT_DESCRIPTION macro since it is needed to properly
	      distinguish between platform options in next.cfg.  This is
	      necessary since the menu layout differs between MacOS/X and
	      MacOS/X Server 1.0 (Rhapsody).  However, Andrew's change made it
	      impossible to make this distinction.
	    - Fixed the csMaterial(csTextureWrapper*) constructor so that it
	      works correctly for the Apple/NeXT platforms when the engine is
	      used as a plugin module.  The problem was that this constructor
	      was invoking another constructor in the same class.  The result
	      of invoking a constructor in this situation is undefined at best
	      since the C++ specification leaves the behavior up to the
	      compiler implementation.  In this case, the result was that none
	      of the instance variables, except `texture', were being
	      initialized.  In particular, the lack of initialization of the
	      SCF goop resulted in IncRef() being called infinitely.  Having
	      fixed this bug, Simplep finally works on Apple/NeXT.
	    - Fixed a problem where many `friend' functions of ddgMatrix4 and
	      ddgVector2 were not declared as `inline' in the respective
	      headers.  This resulted in implementations of these functions
	      appearing in every file which included those headers, which
	      ultimately caused linkage errors.
	    - Eliminated all remaining imports of the deprecated <malloc.h>
	      from platform-independent project sources files.  (Some
	      platform-specific files may still include malloc.h, though.)
	    - Eliminated several compilation warnings reported by the OpenStep
	      compiler throughout the project regarding implicit conversion of
	      void* to some other type.
	    - Eliminated a compilation warning reported by CodeWarrior in
	      csEventQueue::Lock().  The compiler did not like the empty
	      statement following the while() loop.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a overfull hbox TeX warning in meshobj/using.txi.
	- Martin Geisse changed csConfigFile and iConfigFileNew so that
	  comments at the end of a file are now preserved and can be modified
	  by the application.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the following problems in csConfigFile introduced
	  by Martin's changes:
	    - Fixed a dangling-pointer bug in csConfigFile::Clear().
	    - Fixed several problem spots in csConfigFile::LoadFromBuffer()
	      where it could assign the wrong comment as the "end-of-file"
	      comment.
	- Philip Wyett changed dnp_tab.cpp to include malloc.h on Windows.
	- Eric Sunshine reverted Philip's change to dnp_tab.cpp and solved the
	  missing malloc.h problem in a different fashion.  The problem with
	  Philip's change was that his #if test was not well formed, and he
	  also forgot to apply the change to CS/support/gnu/bison.sim, from
	  which dnp_tab.cpp is built.
28-Jan-2001
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a crasher in PTLab where it was trying to
	  access a texture (cslogo.gif) which it had never loaded.
	- Philip Wyett removed the reference to the non-existant texture
	  archive at http://server.empathy.com/crystal.
	- Norman Kramer fixed Save & RestoreArea in iGraphics2D to be
	  good with PixelBytes == 2.
	- Norman also did some fixes on the OpenGL texture cache:
	    - Texture size on caching is now only calculated when needed.
	    - Keycolor setting is now remembered so that it is not processed
	      again when texture handle is created again.
27-Jan-2001
	- Martin Geisse moved the main system/application config files to the
	  new config system.
	- Martin Geisse fixed a bug in the sound loader.
26-Jan-2001
	- Norman Kramer did further work on the video plugins.
	  With exception of yuv2rgb conversion AVI is working.
	- Wouter Wijngaards did nothing important to radiosity.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a compilation warning in prsky.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine Made the following changes to inifile.cpp:
	    - Eliminated compilation warnings about implicit conversion of
	      void* to some other type.
	    - GetYesNo() now also recognizes "1" as true in addition to "yes",
	      "true", and "on".
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed several bugs in radiosity:
	    - Normals when really close up for both lumels. Taking only one
	      normal value would give bad results. This the code now averages
	      for the corners of all lumels.
	    - Set source_patch_size in the config to 1 (did not debug that
	      yet). Vectors a,b when a*b is taken (to get cosinus), lengths
	      must be one. a*b/length(a)/length(b) is only a valid approx
	      when both a and b are pretty large. Close to zero this fails.
	    - When lumels overlap in space (i.e. two polygons with the same
	      texture seamlessly aligning) the distance would become almost
	      zero. Added a test, and at such a moment a derivative of
	      radiosity is applied (the diffuse*area*visibility/PI is taken,
	      no angles/distances are used). This seems to remove all
	      glitches from the radtest level.
	    - To avoid light explosion with radiosity we do a Normalize()
	      for each step now.
25-Jan-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed mazed compilation, by adding csutil
	  library after the cssys for linking.
	- Norman Kramer is still working hard on the new video codec plugins.
24-Jan-2001
	- Small update to Python scripting system.
	- Norman Kramer added dummy audio stream and did some further work
	  on AVI support.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to csConfigFile and
	  iConfigFileNew:
	    - Added SubsectionExists(), which is similar to KeyExists() except
	      that it tests if at least one key exists with the supplied
	      prefix, rather than testing if a particular key exists.
	    - Renamed KeyExist() to KeyExists().
	    - Added GetVFS() to complement existing GetFileName().
	    - Renamed arguments in several method prototypes to clarify and
	      better document their usage and intention.
	    - Upgraded and clarified header comments.  Also removed incorrect
	      references to INI-format files from comments.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to csConfigFile:
	    - Now preserves blank lines in configuration files at save time
	      instead of folding them out.  The blank lines are considered part
	      of the comments.
	    - Fixed bug: SaveNow() was not respecting assertion made by
	      comments in header that a comment could be present but empty.
	    - Now performs more thorough whitespace checking in
	      LoadFromBuffer().
	    - Eliminated the ugly `goto' statements from LoadFromBuffer().
	    - Fixed bug: LoadFromBuffer() was not properly handling CRLF line
	      terminators (though it was handling LF and CR individually).
	    - LoadFromBuffer() now keeps track of the line number of the file
	      being parsed.
	    - LoadFromBuffer() now emits diagnostic messages if it encounters
	      parse errors rather than silently ignoring them.
	    - Fixed bug: LoadFromBuffer() was setting the comment on a node
	      even if the source file did not include a comment.
	    - The methods SetStr(), SetInt(), SetFloat(), SetBool(), and
	      SetComment() are now much smarter about setting the Dirty flag,
	      and only do so if the new value actually differs from the old.
	    - GetBool() now recognizes the string "1" as true in addition to
	      "true", "yes", and "on".
	    - Augmented FindNode() so that it can search for a subsection as
	      well as a full key.  This functionality is used by the new
	      SubsectionExists() method.
	    - csConfigIterator::CheckSubsection() now works correctly when
	      enumerating the entire database (rather than just a subsection).
	    - Resolved several const vs.  non-const issues.  Eliminated the
	      ugly casting of pointers from const to non-const.
	    - Moved the csConfigNode and csConfigIterator class declarations
	      out of cfgfile.h and into cfgfile.cpp.  These are entirely
	      private classes, so there was no need to publish them in a public
	      header.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed scfreg so that it works with the new csConfigFile
	  class.  (Martin forgot to do this when he converted SCF to use the
	  new configuration file format.  The result was that scfreg would
	  blast the contents of scf.cfg.)
	- Eric Sunshine augmented cspython.mak so that it is more permissive
	  about locating the Python static link library.
23-Jan-2001
	- Martin Geisse moved the following to the new config system:
	    - SCF.
	    - Map2CS.
	    - Freetype plugin.
	    - Funcon plugin.
	- Norman Kramer created new stream interface iStream, iAudioStream,
	  iVideoStream, iCodec, iStreamIterator and iStreamFormat. These
	  are mainly for the new video plugins.
	- Norman Kramer did a beginning of AVI implementation (where the
	  opendivx will live as an CODEC). Dont try to compile :)
	- Norman also reorganized the new video plugin system a bit (for
	  playing video's on a texture).
	- Wouter Wijngaards improved texture alignment for the procedural
	  sky. Now colors are computed for the center of a texel - not a
	  corner point.
22-Jan-2001
	- Norman Kramer added a plugin for opendivx (MP4 decoder), note
	  that you need the decoder lib from www.projectmayo.com (its
	  opensource). Plugin compiles now, gonna test it tonite.
	- Removed support from sprites and lights for an old and never-used
	  dynamic lighting registration system. If we still need this later
	  we'll have to redo it another way.
	- Extended iSprite3DState a bit.
	- Extended iMeshObject with GetRadius() function which will return
	  the radius of the object in object space. Also added GetRadius()
	  to csMeshWrapper.
	- Extended all mesh object plugins to support this function.
21-Jan-2001
	- Martin Geisse moved the following modules to the new config system:
	    - Glide renderer/canvas.
	    - DirectX renderer/canvas.
	    - Null renderer.
	    - OpenGL renderer/canvas.
	    - Software renderer.
	- Wouter Wijngaards added intersection point caching to the
	  procedural sky. Speed improvement is only 10%, using several
	  Megs of memory.
20-Jan-2001
	- Martin Geisse removed the remaining entries about the DirectX 5
	  renderer from the config files.
	- Wyatt Miler fixed compiling problems with Codewarrior 6.
	  Also a temporary hack for Codewarrior 6. CW 4&5 users should see
	  if this still works for you.
	- Philip Wyett added include for csgeom/transfrm.h to rain and
	  snow plugins.
19-Jan-2001
	- Martin Geisse moved the following modules to the new config system:
	    - Sound modules
	- Fixed a 'delete' vs 'new[]' bug in csPolygonSet and csSprite3D.
	- Fixed the bug which Martin Geisse reported with sprite frames
	  and actions. They were contained within a csNamedObjVector
	  which is not right because they are not csObject's.
	- Added a 'virtual' to the destructor of the new ini file stuff
	  because otherwise gcc gave warnings.
	- Extended iMeshObject with HardTransform() to do a hard
	  transform on the object. Also added this to csMeshWrapper.
	  Also added SupportsHardTransform() so that an application
	  can test if HardTransform() is supported.
	- Extended iMeshObjectFactory with the same two functions. Sometimes
	  HardTransform() only makes sense on the factory.
	- Implemented HardTransform() in all mesh object plugins. Note
	  that this transformation doesn't affect the orientation of
	  the mesh object. Only the location is changed. Even for particle
	  systems and cube although it could be useful there.
	  Note that for spr2d, snow, and rain HardTransform() don't do
	  anything.
	- Fixed a bug in ball plugin if some setting was changed after
	  already being initialized.
	- Eric Sunshine removed some old COM (pre-SCF) goop from the Macintosh
	  port.
18-Jan-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed Martin's stricmp() in cfgfile.cpp.
	  stricmp is not portable, please use strcasecmp.
	- Martin Geisse added a new module for configuration files with
	  another format than INI. This format uses a flat list of config
	  files with pseudo-hierarchy instead of the sections in INI
	  files. The new system is intended to replace the current system
	  soon.
	- Martin also moved the dungeon plug-in to the new config system
	  and fixed some bugs in both modules.
	- Extended iMeshObject interface with SetVisibleCallback() and
	  GetVisibleCallback(). This function will essentially provide
	  the same functionality as SetDrawCallback2() does for csSprite3D.
	  i.e. callback the application when the object is really (or almost
	  really) visible. Note that you are not allowed to significantly
	  change the layout, position or anything else that might affect
	  visibility in this callback (for obvious reasons).
	- Modified all the current mesh object plugins to support this new
	  callback.
	- Added SetDrawCallback() and GetDrawCallback() to csMeshWrapper.
	  This has the same functionality as the SetDrawCallback() in
	  csSprite3D. i.e. this callback is called when the object is
	  considered for drawing. This means that there is a chance it
	  is visible (but not guaranteed). It is allowed to do minor
	  changes to geometry here as long as you don't change the sectors
	  where this object lives.
	- Added support for frames and actions to iSprite3DFactoryState.
	- Fixed Mazed for my iSpriteFrame changes yesterday.
17-Jan-2001
	- Wouter Windows added more error messages to openglwin32 canvas.
	- Martin Geisse removed current support for threading from the
	  wave-out driver because it produced strange gaps in sound output.
	  It was a bug in the concept. This does not mean that threading
	  won't be supported at all, but not the way it was done till
	  now. Wave-Out is now based on function callback mode, which is
	  also modified to remove the sound gaps.
	- Renamed iskeleton.h to iskel.h to make it work on DOS.
	- Extended iskel.h with several new interface to represent the
	  skeleton structure of a 3D sprite: iSkeletonLimb,
	  iSkeletonConnection, iSkeleton, iSkeletonLimbState,
	  iSkeletonConnectionState, and iSkeletonState. iSkeletonBone
	  is retained and moved to iskelbon.h. It is used by the motion
	  manager and independent as it could be implemented by other
	  bone systems.
	- The skeleton state classes no longer extend csObject. This is
	  not needed and it is not useful because skeleton state classes
	  are going to be moved outside the engine anyway. However, some
	  applications (like WalkTest) require the ability to attach
	  data to state objects so I extended the SCF interfaces with
	  that ability.
	- Modifed WalkTest to use the new user-data instead of the
	  csObject system.
	- Extended the iSprite3DFactoryState interface with
	  EnableSkeletalAnimation() and GetSkeleton(). Also extended
	  iSprite3DState with GetSkeletonState().
	- Also added GetFactory() to iSprite3DState.
	- Extended the iSprite3DFactoryState with various functions to access
	  the vertices, texels, normals, and triangles.
	- Added iSpriteFrame SCF interface and let csFrame implement this.
	- Added iSpriteAction SCF interface and let csSpriteAction implement
	  this.
	- Fixed the 2D sprite plugin so that the initial color table is
	  correctly copied to the real color table at initialization time
	  when lighting is disabled.
	- Changed the 2D sprite plugin so that order of SetColor() and
	  SetLighting() doesn't matter anymore.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a syntax error in irix.mak.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to document.txi:
	    - Fixed a couple factual errors.
	    - Fixed several Texinfo mark-up problems.
	    - Eliminated all of the over- and underfull `hbox' warnings
	      reported by TeX.
	    - Fixed the example @example block so that the Texinfo directives
	      are actually displayed in the output rather than being eaten by
	      the conversion process.
	    - Minor rewriting and enhancement of various topics.
	- Eric Sunshine changed the following classes so that they embed
	  particular SCF interfaces, rather than inheriting them, in order to
	  be NextStep-friendly:
	    csSkeleton                -> iSkeleton
	    csSkeletonState           -> iSkeletonState
	    csSkeletonConnection      -> iSkeletonConnection
	    csSkeletonConnectionState -> iSkeletonConnectionState
16-Jan-2001
	- Eric Sunshine changed the image-copying rule in docs.mak so that it
	  should once again work on Windows/DOS.  (It used to work, but the
	  command-line for copying images became too long, at some point, for
	  the DOS command-line input buffer.)
	- Eric Sunshine removed the broken and unuspported cygwin.mak file.
	- Martin Geisse added some hints to the docs about how to write
	  docs.
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed redefinition errors in OpenGL canvas by
	  explicitly testing for each macro before defining it. This
	  helps opengl canvas compilation on mingw32.
15-Jan-2001
	- Martin Geisse added a patch to csloader by Ed Halley.
	- Fixed a serious bug in csMeshWrapper::SetMeshObject(). This
	  function would do a DecRef() on the given mesh (possibly
	  deleting it).
	- Fixed a bug in WalkTest. It would not release the reference
	  to all created particle systems. This caused memory leaks.
	- Fixed another bug in WalkTest where the particle system was
	  created with the wrong position. Actually, it is the right position
	  but set through the wrong method. Now correctly uses
	  movable.SetPosition() to set the position.
	- Added the first and incomplete include/imspr3d.h which contains
	  the iSprite3DState and iSprite3DFactoryState SCF interfaces that
	  will be used by to access the sprite3d plugin (when it is ready).
	- Wouter Wijngaards increased the speed of skydem (and sky proc
	  texture in csfx) by making the floor simpler.
14-Jan-2001
	- Eric Sunshine fixed vfs.cfg so that it works with MacOS/X Server
	  again following Andrew's change to the meaning of CS_PLATFORM_NAME.
	- Eric Sunshine added several missing /lev/* entries to vfs.cfg.
	- Norman Kramer removed empty and svga displaydrivers for MESA.
	- Norman also did some small modifications to the OpenGL X2D canvas
	  in general:
	    - Explicit set of dispdriver to NULL.
	    - Slightly changed error message when not being able to load
	      from opengl.cfg.
	- Norman did the following changes to the OpenGL renderer:
	    - Enabled the perspective patch in DrawPolygonFX (although its
	      a slowdown i'd rather trade that for a correctly mapped
	      texture).
	    - Perspective patch expected 1/z instead of z as the 3rd
	      coo-value. Since this seemed not consistent with software
	      renderer i changed it to expect a plain z-value.
13-Jan-2001
	- Wyatt Miler did some minor Mac project file adjustment and updated
	  for the new mesh object plugins.
12-Jan-2001
	- Eric Sunshine fixed several bugs in soundraw.cpp where it was
	  applying `delete[]' to a void*.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the makefiles for vsh and vfstest so that they
	  link with the VFS plugin when built `statically'.  These broke for
	  static builds when VFS was moved into its own plug-in module.
	- Wouter Wijngaards added a method to csmeshwrapper to get a
	  pointer to the mesh back again.
	- Wouter also updated win32/directdetection.h to make it
	  backwards compatible to dx3 define. It should compile fine now
	  for dx8. (Also it still compiles fine with older dx versions).
	- Wouter made similar changes in the make install target as the
	  changes in docs from htm to html. The make install target
	  should work once more.
11-Jan-2001
	- Wyatt Miler updated the Macintosh project files.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the project:
	    - Renamed the following project directories:
		CS/plugins/meshldr --> CS/plugins/mesh/loader
		CS/plugins/meshobj --> CS/plugins/mesh/object
	    - Renamed the following SCF class names, prefixes, and suffixes:
		crystalspace.meshldr --> crystalspace.mesh.loader
		crystalspace.meshldr.ZZZfact
		                     --> crystalspace.mesh.loader.factory.ZZZ
		crystalspace.meshobj --> crystalspace.mesh.object
		crystalspace...explo --> crystalspace...explosion
		crystalspace...fount --> crystalspace...fountain
		crystalspace...spr2d --> crystalspace...sprite.2d
	    - Fixed all makefiles, source files, header files, documentation,
	      and `world' files to account for the directory and SCF class name
	      changes.
	- Eric Sunshine moved selection of the software renderer for PLUGINS
	  out of the platform-specific makefiles (CS/libs/cssys/*.mak) and
	  into CS/mk/user.mak since it is not specific to any particular
	  platform.
10-Jan-2001
	- Martin Geisse fixed some minor naming and comment flaws in the
	  idungeon interface file.
	- Martin changed the win32 docs: grouped msvc5 stuff in one section and
	  added a FAQ entry.
	- Martin also committed a patch to win32.cpp from Ed Halley.
	- Martin added some information to the procedural texture docs and
	  added better explanation of the Print() function of the 2D and 3D
	  video driver.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a typo in win32.txi and made several other minor
	  changes.
	- Eric Sunshine changed the file extension on the HTML files in the
	  docs/html and docs/pubapi directories from .htm to .html at Andrew's
	  insistence.  :-)
	- Eric Sunshine lowered the verbosity level of the build process for
	  the HTML version of the User's Manual (make htmldoc).
	- Andrew Zabolotny fixed qsqrt() so that both binutils 2.9.1 and 2.9.5
	  assemble it exactly the same way.
9-Jan-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed a compile warning in WalkTest.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a problem in bmpimage.cpp which caused loading
	  of BMP files on big-endian Solaris to fail.
	- Andrew Zabolotny made the following changes:
	    - Started implementing "hints" at startup.  Actually just wrote a
	      number of them in MazeD.zip::hints.cfg
	    - I decided to change a little the ideology of MazeD.  The
	      ex-"Draft View" will be split now into two different kinds of
	      windows: Model Editors and World Editors.  In Model Editor you
	      will edit models (rooms, things, sprites) and in the World Editor
	      you will place them (without being able to change the models
	      itselves).  mzDraftView component is the common ancestor now for
	      both mzModelEditor and mzWorldEditor components, and can draw the
	      coordinate axis and grid, nothing mode.  The split between
	      DraftView and ModelEditor is finished.
	    - Created the mzWorldEditor window.  It doesn't do much yet, but
	      already has basic functionality.  As the world is loaded, the
	      rooms are "centered" around origin, and a respective
	      mzModelInstance with the respective translation transform is set
	      up.  This allow to edit every room as if it is located in the
	      origin, which is easier.
	    - Fixed a bug recently introduced by somebody.  For software
	      renderer iTextureHandle::Prepare() did no remap_texture() which
	      results in NULL palette->global palette conversion table.  This
	      means you cannot use texture after you do Prepare, but can if you
	      do PrepareAllTextures().  Or alternatively you can call Prepare()
	      then SetGamma() :-) In short, a mess.
	    - Fixed a lot of bugs in fullscreen switching logic for all three
	      X11 canvas plug-ins (x2d, linex2d, glx2d):
		- Moved all the code relevant to fullscreen switching to two
		  files, x2dfs.h and x2dfs.inc for easier maintainance.  All
		  three X11 plugins include them from the relevant .h and .cpp
		  files.
		- Fixed a bug: when a fullscreen mode not matching current
		  canvas size is not available, the canvas may be cleared,
		  which is not desirable.
		- Bug: when current XFree86 videomode is the "best match"
		  videomode for the current canvas size, the canvas driver
		  would hang (loop forever in XWaitEvent).
		- Bug: If videomode does not match canvas size, and canvas
		  resizing is allowed, the canvas size will be adjusted to
		  match videomode.  It was supposed to work before but it
		  didn't.  If canvas resizing is not allowed, the canvas is not
		  resized, but centered instead.
		- Bug: If an unexpected ConfigureNotify would arrive to our
		  window, canvas may be suddenly resized to an erroneous size.
		  I've added a check for ConfigureNotify to be related to our
		  window.
	    - Re-implemented "model instances" in MazeD to allow arbitrary
	      hierarchical structures.  For now the top level of the hierarchy
	      can contain only rooms, although this is not a MazeD limit, it is
	      a engine limit.  Each instance has its move vector and space warp
	      matrix, which are relative to parent object.  Moving/rotating
	      parent object will move/rotate child objects as well.  Model
	      instance position and warp are stored either as a MOVE(), or a
	      HARDMOVE() statement (for rooms and for instances that have the
	      "LockedPos" flag set).  Alas, for now engine doesn't allow rooms
	      at any level other than top level, maybe it makes sense to remove
	      this limitation.  For example, a castle (which would be a room)
	      would contain a hall (child room of castle) which contains
	      something even smaller (child of hall).  Also for now we don't
	      have sector templates, which is bad again (if you duplicate a
	      room multiple times, you'll get it multiple times in output,
	      although it could be avoided).
	- Eric Sunshine fixed several compilation problems in MazeD following
	  Andrew's changes.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a long-standing bug in archive.cpp where
	  csArchive::ArchiveEntry::FreeBuffer() was clobbering the
	  uncompressed-size value.  The bad side-effect of this was that if an
	  attempt was made to re-read the entry's contents later on, the read
	  operation would mysteriously return zero bytes.  This particular
	  problem was often triggered during caching of PVS and Octree data
	  structures.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a bug in the Octree caching code where, in one
	  circumstance, the `write' routine would emit more data than the
	  `read' routine was expecting; with the result that the data stream
	  would become unsynchronized.
	- Eric Sunshine made csPolygonTree's ReadString(), ReadBox3(),
	  ReadVector3(), ReadPlane3(), ReadLong(), ReadUShort(), ReadByte(),
	  and ReadBool() methods more robust by checking for VFS read errors
	  and returning somewhat sensible values rather than returning complete
	  garbage values.
8-Jan-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed procedural sky for OpenGL.
	- Wouter also optimized it a little to use the new qsqrt().
	- Made some initial documentation on the MeshObject system.  Not
	  finished but already useful.  Check it out in
	  docs/texinfo/plugins/meshobj.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the Mesh Object
	  documentation which Jorrit wrote:
	    - Fixed a bunch of Texinfo mark-up errors and problems.
	    - Normalized mark-up and typographical usage to be consistent with
	      other idioms established throughout the manual.
	    - Corrected several typographical and gramatical problems.
	    - Eliminated a bunch of over- and underfull `hbox' errors reported
	      by TeX.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the project:
	    - Added appropriate PIXEL_PREPROC() and PIXEL_POSTPROC()
	      invocations to scanalph.inc in the software renderer so that
	      these functions operate in the same manner as all other functions
	      which take PIXEL_PREPROC() and PIXEL_POSTPROC() into account.
	    - Entirely eliminated the TOP8BITS_R8G8B8_USED flag/mode from the
	      software renderer.  There were several problems with this `patch'
	      which was supposed to handle the case where some of the RGB pixel
	      data occupied the top-byte of the 32-bit pixel:
		o It was fragile.  Each time someone modified or added code to
	          the software renderer, that code had to be checked for
	          breakage.  If broken, then such code had to be fixed.
		o It was difficult and time-consuming to fix these problems.
	          Often, the affected code was spread about in several areas of
	          the renderer.
		o It coupled the software renderer far too tightly to the 2D
	          driver by hardcoding the pixel layout of the 2D driver into
	          the 3D renderer.  (This occurred in pixtype.inc.)  This made
	          it impossible to use an alternate 2D driver with different
	          pixel layout.
	    - Removed the `pixel adjust' value from the software renderer.
	      This was used as part of the TOP8BITS_R8G8B8_USED mechanism.
	    - Note that even though the TOP8BITS_R8G8B8_USED mechanism was
	      removed, I left all of the invocations of PIXEL_PREPROC() and
	      PIXEL_POSTPROC() in place for posterity since they illustrate
	      every place in the renderer where one must take special care to
	      correctly deal with the hard-coded assumptions about pixel
	      layout.  These two macros have been relocated (from various
	      files) to a new master location in scan.h where they are provided
	      with empty definitions.
	    - The default Apple/NeXT 2D driver now post-processes the 32-bit
	      RGB data delivered by the software renderer by re-arranging it
	      into a secondary frame buffer.  This change was necessary for the
	      following reasons:
		o The fragile TOP8BITS_R8G8B8_USED mechanism was removed in
	          order to decouple the 3D renderer from the 2D driver.
		o Without the TOP8BITS_R8G8B8_USED mechanism, the software
	          renderer is hardcoded (for performance reasons) to produce
	          pixel data in a particular format (ARGB on little-endian, and
	          ABGR on big-endian)
		o The pixel data generated by the software renderer is
	          unsuitable for default the Apple/NeXT 2D driver which expects
	          the layout to be ABGR on little-endian and RGBA on
	          big-endian.  (This is a limitation of the AppKit, which is
	          what the default 2D driver is based upon.)
	    - Removed the apparently unused RED_PREPROC() macro from
	      haloscan.inc.
	    - Fixed several copy/paste bugs in csLightMap::ReadFromCache().
	    - Fixed a problem where `make depend' failed on Apple/NeXT when
	      configured for multiple architectures via the TARGET_ARCHS
	      makefile variable.  (Specifically, the compiler could not grok
	      use of -MM with multiple -arch flags.)
	    - Disabled the `quick' versions of QRound() and QInt() on M68K for
	      NeXT.  Even though these methods work correctly on NeXT M68K in
	      general, there were some cases where the compiler botched their
	      invocations and generated incorrect results.
	    - Disabled the new `quick' square-root (in qsqrt.h) for NeXT since
	      the compiler can not grok the contained assembly.
	    - Renamed the preprocessor flag NO_QSQRT to CS_NO_QSQRT.
	    - Fixed a minor problem in -[NeXTDelegate localize:toView:x:y:]
	      where the conversion of the mouse's Y-coordinate was off by one.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the QUERY_PLUGIN() macros in isystem.h so that it
	  is possible to call them as QUERY_PLUGIN(&object, iBlah) rather than
	  having to resort to the ugly QUERY_PLUGIN((&object), iBlah).
	- Eric Sunshine fixed vfstest.cpp so that it no longer instantiates
	  the VFS plug-in twice.
	- Eric Sunshine changed all of the platform-specific makefiles so that
	  they consistently use LIBS.SOCKET.SYSTEM to specify the Socket
	  library.  Eliminated the old, unix-specific NEED_SOCKET_LIB flag.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed problems in socket.mak where it did not link with
	  the correct libraries when static linking was used.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the platform-specific makefiles so that they
	  consistently use the makefile variables CFLAGS.D, CFLAGS.I, LFLAGS.L,
	  and LFLAGS.l.
7-Jan-2001
	- Made usage of qisqrt() more sensible. First test if square
	  is less than some amount then you don't have to do the entire
	  qisqrt().
	- By making use of the new qisqrt() I optimized csCamera::LookAt()
	  a little more.
6-Jan-2001
	- Created snow and rain mesh object plugins (for the snow and rain
	  particle systems).
	- Created iSnowState and iRainState interfaces to access these plugins.
	- Modified WalkTest to use the new snow and rain plugins instead of
	  the old particle systems in csfx.
	- Finished the snow and rain loader plugins.
	- Moved spiral particle system to plugin. Note that this particle
	  system currently crashes. Also created the loader and modified
	  WalkTest.
	- Removed native support for loading particle systems in csloader.
	  Particle systems are now loaded through the new MESHOBJ keyword
	  and the plugins. This means that the flarge.zip you can find
	  on the CS site will no longer work. I will soon put a replacement
	  there.
	- Removed dependency on CSFX library from most apps (all except
	  simple) since the loader no longer depends on csfx itself.
	- Removed particle support from csengine. All particles have now
	  moved to plugins.
	- Fixed the new qsqrt and qisqrt from Andrew. It appears that it
	  was returning the negative square root. I negated the result.
	  I modified several places in csengine and csgeom where either
	  FastSqrt (the old one) and normal sqrt were used and replaced it
	  with qsqrt() and qisqrt(). All seems to work well but in case
	  something bad happens I added a define NO_QSQRT to include/qsqrt.h.
	  If you enable this define the fast versions of qsqrt will not be
	  used. I'd like to be notified of this if there are problems.
	- Made a new ball plugin just for demonstration purposes and also
	  because it is a very efficient way to make a ball :-)
	  Extended simple application to show such a ball with a plasma
	  texture on top of it (just turn around to see it). It looks
	  really nice :-)
	- Philip Wyett fixed several compile errors in demosky.
	- Philip also fixed the ddraw canvas to actually open windowed
	  when it is told to.
5-Jan-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards Added a procedural skybox texture.
	  And a demoing program (ala simple) to show it. 'demosky'.
	  the bottom half of the skybox is filled with a mock watery splotch,
	  the top half with clouds and a sunlighted spot.
	- Wouter Wijngaards says: From Harald Fielker
	  (fielker@informatik.fh-augsburg.de) I got an addition to csloader,
	  a LoadThing and LoadThingTemplate methods. You can load a thing
	  from a vfs file with them.
	- Norman Kramer replaced AdvanceSpriteFrames with engines NextFrame
	  for cctest.
	- Fixed a big initialization bug in the spr2d plugin. This would
	  cause strange and hard to debug crashes sometimes.
	- Fixed a very similar initialization bug in the fountain and
	  explosion plugins.
	- Fixed another bug in the general particle code for the particle
	  plugins. Particles were DecRef()'ed once too many.
	- Fixed csMeshWrapper::NextFrame() so that it also calls NextFrame
	  on the children.
	- csSprite no longer implements iParticle. In the future it will
	  be the mesh objects themselves that implement iParticle. At this
	  moment however, it means that only the 2D sprite mesh objects
	  work as particles (which is fine since these are actually the
	  only objects that are really useful as particles).
	- Also removed csSprite::AddColor() and SetColor() since they
	  were actually only ment for the particle systems. Moved AddColor()
	  and SetColor() as specific functions for csSprite3D.
	- Moved implementation of csSprite::Rotate() and ScaleBy() to
	  csSprite and made non virtual. The implementation was the same
	  for all subclasses anyway.
	- Changed iParticle interface to make it possible to use relative
	  transforms for particle systems. The transform of the parent
	  particle system is given with Draw() and UpdateLighting().
	  SetPosition() should now be specified in the particle system
	  coordinate system.
	- The particle system plugins now render correctly in a hierarchical
	  transformation context. This gives really very nice effects.
	  For example, I put a fountain particle system on the hand of the
	  robot (which is rotating). This looks as if the robot is shooting
	  around with fountain particles.
	- Finished the explosion particle system loader plugins.
	- Started working on the fire particle system (in
	  plugins/meshobj/fire).
	- Added iFireState interface for the fire plugin system.
	- Finished the fire plugin and changed WalkTest to use it instead
	  of the old version in csfx.
	- Finished the fire loader plugins.
	- Implemented MIXMODE command in all mesh object loader plugins.
4-Jan-2001
	- Martin Geisse moved volume control from the sound drivers to
	  the software sound renderer. Also cleaned up the wave-out driver
	  a bit.
	- Andrew Zabolotny fixed the disaster caused to VFS by one of
	  Eric's changes. CS_PLATFORM_NAME was not the strict name of
	  platform like it should be, but rather a free-form description
	  of the platform, which is wrong.
	- The sprited2D plugin now also implements iParticle which means
	  it can be directly used as a particle for the particle systems.
	- The particle systems now use the sprite2d plugin directly instead
	  of using csSprite2D.
	- As a consequence of this I'm now able to remove csSprite2D
	  from the engine. In addition I also removed support for loading
	  2D sprites directly. Instead the new MESHOBJ token should be used.
	- Forgot to implement support for the MATERIAL keyword in the
	  sprite2d loader (the factory loader did support it).
	- Started work on moving particle systems to plugins. There is
	  now a directory plugins/meshobj/partgen which contains the
	  general classes for particle systems (csParticleSystem
	  and csNewtonianParticleSystem).
	- Added iParticleState interface which represents the general
	  settings common to all particle systems. csParticleSystem
	  implements this.
	- Started moving fountain particle system to plugins. Source can
	  be found in plugins/meshobj/fountain.
	- Added iFountainState interface which represents the general
	  settings specific for the fountain. csFountainParticleSystem
	  implements this.
	- Fixed SCF macros for csPolygonSet, csSprite, csSkeletonLimbState
	  and csPolygon3D. They were all using IMPLEMENT_IBASE_EXT
	  but forgot to close this with IMPLEMENT_IBASE_EXT_END (instead
	  they used the default IMPLEMENT_IBASE_END).
	- Added NextFrame to csSprite and implement this in all the
	  current remaining subclasses (csParticleSystem, csMeshWrapper,
	  and csSprite3D).
	- Added similar NextFrame() to iMeshObject.
	- Added empty implementation of NextFrame() to cube and 2D sprite
	  plugins. They don't have animation so they don't need a NextFrame().
	- Added a functional implementation of NextFrame() to the general
	  particle system plugin code.
	- Renamed csEngine::AdvanceSpriteFrames() to NextFrame(). In
	  addition it will now also control animation and deletion of
	  particle systems.
	- Removed UpdateParticleSystems() because csEngine::NextFrame()
	  does this.
	- Finished the fountain plugin. The fountain plugin itself uses
	  the 2D sprite plugin to create the fountain particles.
	- Added WantToDie() to iMeshObject. With this function a mesh
	  can indicate that it wants to die. This is most useful for particle
	  systems that have only a limited time to live (like an explosion).
	- Also added default WantToDie() to csSprite and implemented it
	  in csMeshWrapper by asking the mesh. By doing this the auto-delete
	  system of particle systems is generalized to all mesh objects.
	- Started moving explosion particle system to plugins. Source can
	  be found in plugins/meshobj/explo.
	- Added iExplosionState interface which represents the general
	  settings specific for the explosion. csExploParticleSystem
	  implements this.
	- Added iDynLight SCF interface for dynamic lights. This is needed
	  for the explosion plugin.
	- Extended iLight SCF interface with SetColor() and SetSector().
	- Extended iEngine with CreateDynLight() and RemoveDynLight().
	- Finished the explosion plugin. Note that there still seems to be
	  a bug with lighting and the particles of the particle systems.
	  Sometimes the lighting routine on the particle system is not
	  called (UpdateLighting).
	- Changed walktest to use the fountain and explosion plugins instead
	  of the still existing fountain particle systems in csfx.
	- Fixed a CSFX dependency error in the blocks makefile.
	- Implemented the fountain loader plugin (in plugins/meshldr/fountain).
3-Jan-2001
	- Andrew Zabolotny did the following changes to CS:
	    - Enhanced a little software DrawPixmap for
	      textures-with-alphamap, where in 16 and 8 bpp modes alpha=0
	      still would lead to a changing background a little.
	    - Added a nice logo to MazeD's About box.
	    - Fixed a few things here and there in MazeD.
	    - A new QInt and QRound that will work on some big-endian CPUs
	      as well.
	    - Fix to slow QRound so that it works correctly for negative
	      numbers.
	    - A new fast sqrt() and 1/sqrt() implementation. Not used
	      anywhere for now (I'll leave this on Jorrit's behalf) but it
	      has a big potential. Engine is using 1/sqrt() in a lot of
	      places, and computing 1/sqrt() in one go is a big win. Plain
	      sqrt() is about 31% faster (on PII and Celeron) than FPU's
	      FSQRT instruction, and 1/sqrt() is 38% faster than FSQRT
	      (dunno how fast than actually computing 1/sqrt(x) - division
	      is quite a slow operation, almost as slow as sqrt itself - 42
	      and 71 clocks respectively).
	- Wouter Wijngaards improved the portal more. It has a border around
	  the portal polygon, showing a part of the portal texture mapped
	  on it.
	- Added GetObjectBoundingBox() to iMeshObject.
	  Added implementation for this method to the cube plugin.
	- Implemented UpdateInPolygonTrees() in csMeshWrapper so that
	  mesh objects will now correctly be drawn in BSP type levels too.
	- Implemented csMeshWrapper::Rotate().
	- Started porting csSprite2D (2D sprites) to the new mesh
	  plugin system. Created new directory plugins/meshobj/spr2d
	  where it will be located.
	- Also created iSprite2DFactoryState SCF interface which will
	  be used to set the characteristics of 2D sprite factories. Also
	  added iSprite2DState to set the characteristics of 2D sprite
	  instances.
	- Renamed iCubeMeshObject to iCubeFactoryState because I think this
	  is a better name which also fits the name of the 2D sprite
	  state interfaces better.
	- Also created the 2D sprite loaders.
	- Plugin 2D sprites are now working mostly. The old 2D sprites are not
	  yet removed because the particle systems still depend on them.
	- Extended iMovable and csMovable with GetFullPosition() which returns
	  the position of the movable but keeps track of the hierarchical
	  transformations (similar to GetFullTransform()).
	- Fixed a serious bug in csloader with regards to the new plugin
	  loaders. The wrong type plugin was taken in some cases.
	- Removed MoveToSector from iParticle. It is not needed and wrong
	  if used in combination with the new mesh object system (they have no
	  notion of sectors).
	- Removed DeferUpdateLighting() from iParticle.
	- Changed iParticle::UpdateLighting() to take an array of iLight
	  instead of csLight. SCF classes should not refer to engine classes.
	- Changed iParticle::Draw() to use iRenderView instead of csRenderView.
	- Added iLight::GetPrivateObject() and iRenderView::GetPrivateObject().
2-Jan-2001
	- Philip Wyett fixed a small VC compiler warning.
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed a compile warning.
	- Completed a fix Eric Sunshine did (previous millenium) with regards
	  to CalculateFogMesh. Eric missed a tiny detail. Oops! :-)
	- Added an extra level of abstraction in the mesh object system.
	  Created a plugin called iMeshObjectType which represents a type
	  of mesh objects. From this you can created instances of
	  iMeshObjectFactory. So iMeshObjectFactory is no longer a plugin
	  but instances have to be created through iMeshObjectType.
	- Added csCubeMeshObjectType in the cube plugin to implement
	  iMeshObjectType.
	- Added new QueryPlugIn to iSystem and system.h with which you can
	  query for a loaded plugin on class ID. This complements the two
	  other existing QueryPlugIn functions which could look for Func ID
	  and interface name. The reason for this function is that you
	  sometimes want to load a plugin with a certain class ID but you
	  only want one. If there already is one you reuse the previously
	  loaded plugin instance. So in that case you do QUERY_PLUGIN_CLASS
	  first and if that fails (returns NULL) you do LOAD_PLUGIN.
	- Also added QUERY_PLUGIN_CLASS which will use the new QueryPlugIn.
	- Added GetNumPlugIns() and GetPlugIn() to iSystem and system.h.
	  With this you can query the list of currently loaded plugins in
	  the system.
	- Fixed a bug in csloader which would cause the loader plugins to
	  be loaded multiple times instead of only once.
	- csCubeMeshObjectType now also implements iConfig through embedding.
	  Using this you can set the default size (x, y, and z) and the default
	  shift (x, y, and z) for all factories created from this object
	  mesh type.
	- Added 'plugins' console command to WalkTest with which you can
	  ask all loaded plugins (loaded into the system driver).
	- Added 'conflist' console command to WalkTest with which you can
	  ask all config options for some loaded plugin (use the 'plugins'
	  command to get the list of plugins). You also get the current values
	  of the options. For example 'conflist 3' will list all the config
	  options and values for the plugin with number 3 (from the list
	  given by 'plugins').
	- Added 'confset' console command to WalkTest with which you can
	  set a config option to some value. Arguments are <plugnr>,<name>,<val>
	  with <plugnr> the number you get from the 'plugins' command.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a compilation warning from walkcmd.cpp.
1-Jan-2001
	- Added 'children' array to csMeshWrapper. By this we will support
	  hierarchical objects and transformations.
	- Added support for MESHOBJ keyword in MESHOBJ. This will be used
	  to specify the hierarchical objects. i.e. the mesh objects can
	  be children of a parent mesh object. The transformation specified
	  in the children is relative to the parent position and orientation.
	- Generalized csRotatingObject in the entity system of WalkTest
	  so that it will now also be able to rotate sprites instead of
	  only things (sprites in the general sense: csSprite, so the new
	  plugin objects are also included).
	- Added support for KEY keyword in MESHOBJ.
	- Modified WalkTest so that it will also recognize the children
	  of csMeshWrapper and parse the KEY statements for them.
	- Changed iCubeMeshObject to make it more general. You can now
	  specify the sizes for x, y, and z seperatelly. So the cube does
	  not have to be a cube anymore :-)
	- Also added shift values so that you can shift the (0,0,0) point
	  of the cube to another place.
	- Fixed a bad bug with UpdateLighting for the cube plugin. In some
	  cases it would actually crash because UpdateLighting was called
	  before the cube object was properly initialized. Added SetupObject()
  	  function to initialize cube properly and if needed.
	- Hierarchical objects are now working :-)
31-Dec-2000
	- Eric Sunshine fixed compilation warnings in engine.cpp, rview.cpp,
	  meshobj.cpp, prdots.cpp, prfire.cpp, proctex.cpp, cubeldr.cpp, and
	  cube.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a bizarre bug in csRenderView's
	  CalculateFogMesh() where a local `fog_info' variable was incorrectly
	  initialized.  (There is no way that this code could have ever worked
	  correctly prior to being repaired.)
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a bug in cspython.mak where it would potentially
	  try to compile cs_pyth.cpp twice.
	- Eric Sunshine modified the Python plug-in makefile so that
	  compilation warnings are disabled for the Swig-generated cs_pyth.cpp
	  source file.  This was done since cs_pyth.cpp is known to spew many
	  compilation warnings, yet because it is auto-generated, it is out of
	  our control to eliminate the warnings.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the broken `linex2dclean' makefile target.
30-Dec-2000
	- Philip Wyett fixed some of the 3D renderers that Jorrit forgot
	  to fix yesterday.
	- Got two nice textures from Wouter Wijngaards to use for the
	  'portal' console command. The textures are in standard.zip.
	  Only the texture for the box of the portal is used for now.
	  There are some technical problems to getting the other texture
	  working correctly.
	- Added iLoaderPlugIn interface. A mesh object plugin (or something
	  else, it is general enough) can implement this in order to
	  provide extra loading functionality for the loader.
	- Renamed csMeshObject to csMeshWrapper in order not to let people
	  think that csMeshWrapper actually implements iMeshObject
	  (it does not).
	- Added csMeshFactoryWrapper which is a class similar to what
	  csSpriteTemplate is for sprites.
	- Added iMeshFactoryWrapper and let csMeshFactoryWrapper implement
	  this through embedding.
	- Extended iEngine and csEngine with FindMeshFactory().
	- Extended iRegion and csRegion with FindMeshFactory() and extended
	  csRegion to actually support mesh object factories as well.
	- Added new array of mesh object factories in csEngine
	  (meshobj_factories).
	- Implemented cube loader plugins. One for cube factories and one
	  for regular cubes. These plugins are placed in plugins/meshldr/cube.
	- Added support for MESHOBJ keyword in WORLD (loader). This will
	  generate a general csMeshWrapper object for the specified
	  plugin. For example, to load an instance of the cube factory
	  in the world you can do:
	  	MESHOBJ 'cubeFact' (
		    PLUGIN ('crystalspace.meshldr.cubefact')
		    PARAMS (
		        MATERIAL ('stone')
			SIZE (.5)
		    )
		)
	  The section in the 'PARAMS' block will be passed to the plugin
	  loader.
	- Added support for MESHOBJ keyword in SECTOR or ROOM. This is
	  based on the factory above:
	  	MESHOBJ 'cube1' (
		    PLUGIN ('crystalspace.meshldr.cube')
		    PARAMS (
		        FACTORY ('cubeFact')
		    )
		    MOVE (V (-4,0,9))
		)
	- Fixed some of the FindXxx() routines in csEngine so that they
	  actually return NULL if the object is not found instead of
	  some low (but invalid) value.
29-Dec-2000
	- Added iRenderView::ClipBBox() to test if a screen bounding box
	  is visible and needs to be clipped. In addition it does far plane
	  clipping. Thus it provides a quick and easy way for a mesh object
	  plugin to test if some object is visible and needs to be clipped.
	  The code is a straight copy from the code that was in csSprite3D.
	  csSprite3D now also uses this function.
	- Made iClipper2D and csClipper::ClassifyBox use a 'const' parameter.
	- Cube also uses clipping correctly now.
	- Extended iMeshObject with DrawTest() and UpdateLighting().
	  DrawTest() is the first part of Draw() which is responsible for
	  testing quick visibility. Draw() will do the real work. In between
	  UpdateLighting() can optionally be called.
	- Added IsMirrored() to iCamera.
	- Fixed the Python plugin for the change of GetAspect() to GetFOV().
	- Changed iGraphics3D::GetObjectToCamera() so that it returns a
	  reference to the transformation. Modified all the 3D drivers
	  accordingly.
	- Extended iLight SCF structure to make it useful for calculating
	  lighting in the cube plugin.
	- Changed csLight to let it implement iLight through embedding
	  instead of inheritance.
	- Fixed UpdateLighting() for csMeshObject.
	- Added SetMixMode() and GetMixMode() to iCubeMeshObject interface.
	- Did some cleanup to various of the SCF include files (comments
	  and CS code style).
	- All the above changes accomplish the following for the cube plugin:
	    - Lighting works now (similarly to how sprite lighting works but
	      a bit simpler).
	    - Cube will be correctly rendered through a mirror.
	    - Changed Simple so that the new cube moves around at the
	      same rate as the dynamic light at the top of the room.
	      That way you can see how the lighting is dynamically updated.
	    - Cube now uses the plasma procedural texture.
	    - Cube is now drawn with CS_FX_ADD mixmode for a nice blending
	      effect. This does not work correctly in software mode though
	      because there is a bug with blending and procedural textures.
	      The initialization of the procedural textures (which are
	      8-bit textures) overwrites the blend tables for the 16/32-bit
	      render mode as well.
28-Dec-2000
	- Philip Wyett made a small fix to the cube plugin header.
	- Seth Galbraith added more error checking to the MD2 importer.
	- Added Visit() to iMaterialWrapper.
	- Cube plugin now renders using DrawTriangleMesh().
	- Added CalculateFogMesh() and CalculateFogPolygon() to iRenderView.
	  Mesh object plugins can call this function to update the fog
	  information in the mesh or poly object. Removed the badly
	  placed same functions from pol2d.cpp.
	- Cube plugin now supports fog.
	- Added iTransformationManager SCF interface for the transformation
	  manager. Only contains GetCookie() function at the moment.
	  csTransformationManager implements this interface through
	  embedding.
	- Added iEngine::GetTransformationManager().
	- Added iRenderView::GetEngine().
27-Dec-2000
	- Added iCubeMeshObject interface. The cube plugin implements
	  this interface in addition to iMeshObjectFactory. Using
	  iCubeMeshObject you can specify the geometric constraints
	  and appearance of the cube (size and texture). Every mesh object
	  plugin will have such a companion interface to specify appearance.
	- Added GetMaterialHandle() to iMaterialWrapper interface.
	- Extended Draw() in iMeshObject with an iMovable parameter.
	- Added GetTransform() in iCamera.
	- Made QUERY_INTERFACE macro a wee bit safer.
	- Fixed a bug in csCamera. One of the constructors didn't properly
	  initialize the SCF stuff for iCamera. Also changed csCamera
	  so that iCamera is now implemented through embedding instead
	  of inheritance.
	- Changed GetAspect() and GetInvAspect() to GetFOV() and GetInvFOV()
	  in iCamera.
	- Added GetShiftX() and GetShiftY() to iCamera.
	- Fixed the SCF stuff for csRenderView. It was not properly done
	  given that csCamera itself implements iBase.
	- Continued work on csCubeMesh plugin so that it now renders a
	  wireframe version.
26-Dec-2000
	- Samuel Humphreys did the following:
	    - Little clean up of ptlab.
	    - Fixed procedural textures after AndyZ's recent changes.
	    - Removed Jorrit's additional PrepareTextures() from protex3d.cpp.
	    - Fixed Simple to display procedural textures properly with the
	      global palette properly communicated.
	    - Cleaned up csphyzik library file formatting.
	- csParser no longer deletes all textures and materials in the
	  MATERIALS and TEXTURES statement. This caused bad crashes with the
	  portal command. The portal command is now working properly again.
	- Added iRenderView and let csRenderView implement this through
	  embedding.
	- Added iClipper2D and let csClipper implement this through
	  inheritance.
	- Removed csClipper::IsInside(x,y) so that only the csVector2 version
	  remains.
	- Renamed the in-place clipper from 'Clip' to 'ClipInPlace' to avoid
	  C++ inheritance clashes.
	- Added iMeshObject interface which will eventually be used
	  to move sprites, and particle systems outside the engine as plugins.
	- Additionally added iMeshObjectFactory plugin. This is a plugin
	  that can be loaded in the engine will generate instances of
	  one type of mesh object.
	- Added csCubeMeshObject as a plugin (in plugins/meshobj/cube) which
	  represents a simple cube that is going to be used as a test-base
	  for the new iMeshObject system. Only when csCubeMeshObject is
	  working properly; I am going to port csSprite3D and csParticleSystem
	  to iMeshObject.
	- Added csMeshObject which is the engine's implementation of
	  iMeshObject. csMeshObject is eventually going to replace csSprite.
	  It will controll all aspects of mesh objects which are global and
	  pass them on to the various implementations of iMeshObject.
	- Added code to Simple to query this new cube plugin.
25-Dec-2000
	- Norman Kramer changed csPixmap so that it calls IncRef() and
	  DecRef() on the contained iTextureHandle.  He states that he came
	  across this issue when someone added an `engine->StartEngine()'
	  invocation to LoadMapFile(); all his pixmaps that held
	  iTextureHandles created via LoadTexture() before LoadMapFile() was
	  invoked became invalid.
24-Dec-2000
	- Norman Kramer added CSFX lib to several of the makefiles.
	- Eric Sunshine made a slight modification to handling of the Backspace
	  key in the OpenStep port so that it works in the expected fashion in
	  Crystal Space.
	- Eric Sunshine added documentation for the `walkall' makefile target
	  to the output of the `help' makefile target.
23-Dec-2000
	- Norman Kramer fixed a bug in the bmp loader.
	- Moved snow, rain, spiral, fountain, fire, and explosion particle
	  systems from csengine to csfx library. Only the basic particle
	  and newtonian particle systems remain in csengine.
	- Found out that materials and textures were not correctly searched
	  in the current region. Fixed csloader for this.
	- Fixed a potential bug with polygons that had no texture. The
	  new Visit() would crash on them. It seems however that there is
	  still a bug somewhere. The portal command is very unreliable now.
	  To be investigated.
	- Extended csLoader::FindMaterial() with a regionOnly parameter.
	- Added csEngine::FindCsTexture() and FindCsMaterial() which return
	  a csTextureHandle and csMaterialHandle respectively.
22-Dec-2000
	- Eliminated a bug in the procedural texture manager for the software
	  renderer.  The problem was that only the first 8-bit proc texture was
	  correctly initialized.
	- Fixed csfx so that there is only one Initialize() method now as was
	  originally intended.
	- Disabled lighting for the fire and water polygons that are created in
	  simple.  Now fire and water will actually look like fire and water
	  without having a green tint (from the nearby green light).
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the project:
	    - Upgraded the NextStep port of Crystal Space to be fully
	      compatible with Andrew's National Keyboard Support.  Implementing
	      this required reverse engineering internal NextStep data
	      structures and writing code to extract the appropriate
	      information.  See the discussion in the new NeXTKeymap.cpp file
	      for a detailed explanation.  (National Keyboard Support had
	      already been enabled for the MacOS/X Server and OpenStep ports
	      several days earlier.)
	    - Fixed a long-standing problem with keyboard handling in the
	      NextStep port.  Keystrokes modified by the Alternate key were
	      never interpreted correctly by Crystal Space.  The reason for
	      this was that NextStep had already cooked the keystroke
	      completely out of recognition by the time Crystal Space had a
	      chance to see it, and there was no way to retrieve the original,
	      unmodified keystroke.  Reverse engineering the internal NeXT data
	      structures for National Keyboard Support made it possible to fix
	      this problem by making the unmodified (raw) keystroke available.
	    - Implemented F1 - F12 function key translation in the NextStep
	      port.  (These keys had already been implemented in the MacOS/X
	      Server and OpenStep ports several days earlier.)
21-Dec-2000
	- Philip Wyett fixed a small bug in texture.h.
	- Philip also found a bug in ~SoftwareCachedTexture () which
	  causes an on exit error in "appptlab" in Windows. Because of
	  possible side effects I have merely commented above the offending
	  line for resolution at a later date/more convenient time..
	  Hope that is OK.
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed the macintosh pow() command for radiosity.
20-Dec-2000
	- Continued work on csfx library. Implemented support for a random
	  dot proc texture, plasma, fire and water (the last three are
	  taken from ptlab and were added to that application by Wouter
	  Wijngaards).
	- Added the notion of a use-callback for a csTextureWrapper.
	  This callback will be called right before a texture is used. Using
	  this callback you can make sure that procedural textures are only
	  updated when really needed (i.e. a polygon/object using the proc
	  texture is visible). Note that the callback can be called several
	  times in one frame if visible. The callback should keep this in
	  mind and use the current time to check if the callback should do
	  something.
	- Extended csTextureWrapper and csMaterialWrapper with a Visit()
	  function. The engine will call Visit() whenever the texture or
	  material is used. Visit() will call the use callback.
	- Note that this Visit() function is on csTextureWrapper and
	  not on iTextureHandle. This means that (for example) csPixmap
	  will not be able to fire this callback. If you use a procedural
	  texture on a csPixmap then you'll have to do the call to Animate
	  on your own.
	- Added GetMaterialWrapper() to csCurve.
	- Extended simple with a demo on how to use the new csfx
	  library. Added a cube with six sides demonstrating the various
	  procedural textures. Due to the new texture callback system the
	  procedural textures are only updated when needed.
	- There is currently an ugly hack in csProcTexture because there
	  seems to be a bug in the software procedural texture implementation
	  when several procedural textures are initialized from Register
	  to Prepare (i.e. interleaved Register/Prepare as opposed to first
	  doing all Register and then all Prepare). That's why there is
	  now an Initialize1 and Initialize2. If the bug is fixed this will
	  be removed.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a compilation warning in me_matmn.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to MetaBalls:
	    - Fixed bug which prevented statistical text from displaying.  This
	      bug has existed since the beginning of time but was only
	      triggered recently.  The problem was that the `count' instance
	      variable, which plays a role in determining when statistics
	      should be displayed, was never initialized.
	    - Added default initializers for all other instance variables (in
	      addition to `count').
	    - Removed unnecessary call to csSystem::GetElapsedTime().
	    - Fixed bug: MetaSys::Help() was printing null-pointer for default
	      texture name.
	    - No longer crashes when unable to load texture.  Now prints
	      meaningful error message and exits cleanly.
19-Dec-2000
	- Andrew Zabolotny did the following changes:
	    - Fixed a error in inifile.cpp. The array allocated with
	      new[] was realloc()'ated. Now it is new/memcpy/delete'd.
	    - Fixed a minor memory leak in system driver. Event cords
	      weren't deleted at shutdown.
	    - Fixed a bad error in inifile.cpp triggered by [Macintosh]
	      section in vfs.cfg: the loader switches to base64 mode due
	      to empty assignments like:
		HOME =
	      (such lines are used to denote base64 keys) and then
	      doesn't switch back when it detects invalid base64 symbols.
	      I changed the ini loader so that it switches to base64 mode
	      by '==' statement, e.g.:
		HOME ==
		ODAwMDAwMDAgd2hpbGUKICAgIHNoYXJlZCBs
		aWJyYXJpZXMgdXN1YWxseSBoYXZlIGFkZHJl
		c3NlcyBsaWtlIDB4NHh4eHh4eHgpLgo=
		===
		;/HOME
	      If you want to assign the '=' value to a key, insert a space,
	      e.g:
		HOME = =
	      is interpreted as a normal key, not the head of a base64
	      stream. csIniFile::Save() inserts spaces automatically, thus
	      a saved ini file should read perfectly. Also if something other
	      than newline follows the second equal sign, it is also
	      interpreted as a normal key.
	    - Fixed a few memory leaks in MazeD.
	    - Finished material manager dialog. Now it is functional, use
	      Ctrl+m to invoke it, model manager has moved to Ctrl+M. Fixed
	      several bugs that leads to MazeD crashes related to materials.
	    - Fixed a bad bug in common texture manager object (txtmgr.cpp):
	      the constructor did no CONSTRUCT_IBASE.
	    - I have enhanced the memory debugger so that on Linux and OS/2
	      it is able to debug malloc/realloc/free's as well as new's and
	      delete's. There is a drawback on Linux though: it will
	      intercept all malloc/free's from all dynamic libraries (even
	      from libX11.so) thus you will see a lot of memory leaks
	      belonging to other libraries (notably libc and libX11). You can
	      filter them by address (in Linux program address is >
	      0x80000000 while shared libraries usually have addresses like
	      0x4xxxxxxx). If you want to debug memory leaks in plug-ins,
	      build executable in static link mode.
	    - Fixed a memory leak in csfont plug-in.
	    - Rearrangement of some aspects of the texture manager to simplify
	      interface API for textures and materials. Previously you had to
	      call texture manager's RegisterXXX (where XXX is Texture or
	      Material) then you had to call PrepareXXX to force texture
	      manager recompute the internal representation of the
	      texture/material; when you are done you had to call
	      UnregisterXXX. Now it works a little different: by calling
	      RegisterXXX you create a new texture/material handle, and
	      further you work only with that handle: call handle->Prepare()
  	      to prepare texture or material for usage; call handle->DecRef()
	      enough times to destroy the handle (you don't have to call
	      UnregisterXXX anymore).
	      I have fixed all the 3D renderers for this, however I'm not
	      sure about Direct3D and Glide renderers (haven't compiled
	      them). All others are fully functional.
	      You can still call PrepareTextures() and PrepareMaterials()
              on texture manager object to call Prepare on all objects at once.
	    - Renamed csTextureMMSoftware into csSoftwareTextureHandle and
	      csTextureMM into csTextureHandle for cleaner names.
	    - Before closing the system (System::Close) the engine will
	      free all texture and material handles since after closing
	      the graphics driver the handles become invalid no matter
	      whenever we did IncRef or not.
	    - Implemented alpha textures support for DrawPolygon, DrawPFX
	      and DrawPixmap in OpenGL renderer.
	    - Re-worked OpenGL texture cache. Texture unloading happens now
	      in a centralized routine, which minimizes the effort required
	      to fix any bugs in it (one of which was causing SIGSEGV on
	      exit).
	- Fixed python plugin after Andrew broke it with the changes
	  above (i.e. remove PrepareTexture() from the cs.i file).
	- Philip Wyett fixed a few compile errors in OpenGL renderer
	  after Andrew's commit.
18-Dec-2000
	- Rene Dudfield fixed a bug in sprite3d. The rand num generator
	  was not initialized.
	- Rene Dudfield also made the sprite3d lighting functions only
	  light the vertices that are used for the lod level.
	- Fixed a bug in WalkTest with ms->snd not being initialized to
	  NULL on systems that don't have sound support. This could result
	  in crashes when firing missiles.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the project:
	    - Repaired the MacOS/X Server, OpenStep, and NextStep ports of
	      Crystal Space after they had sat idle for several months.  Many
	      core-level changes to the project during the idle time broke
	      these ports rather severely.  The ports are probably about 97%
	      functional now compared to how functional they were once.  Some
	      problems still exist which will be addressed in subsequent repair
	      and upgrade sessions.  For instance, the NextStep port is not yet
	      fully compatible with Andrew's new National Keyboard Support.
	      Full compatiblity requires reverse engineering internal NextStep
	      structures.  The MacOS/X Server and OpenStep ports, on the other
	      hand, are now compatible with the National Keyboard Support.
	      Further, certain portions of the software renderer (which Andrew
	      updated since the last time I repaired all such problems) are
	      broken for the Apple/NeXT ports running at 32-bit mode on
	      big-endian hardware.  Future plans also include a port to the
	      upcoming MacOS/X, as well as further decoupling of the 2D driver
	      from the system driver.
	    - The default NeXT 2D canvas is now responsible for the querying
	      and interpreting its own `simulated depth' option.  This is no
	      longer the responsibility of the system driver.
	    - Eliminated iNeXTSystemDriver (NeXTSystemInterface.h) which
	      published a method to report the simulated-depth value to the 2D
	      canvas.  The canvas is now entirely responsible for this feature,
	      so the system driver need not publish this any longer.
	    - NeXTSystemDriver now manages an iEventOutlet which the 2D canvas
	      can use for default handling of mouse and keyboard events.
	    - NeXTSystemDriver now implements SystemExtension() to provide
	      default mouse and keyboard event handling on behalf of canvases,
	      as well as other functionality.
	    - Promoted the ability to suspend the engine's virtual-time clock
	      into csSystemDriver from NeXTSystemDriver where this feature was
	      originally implemented.  This is useful for ports which allow the
	      user to suspend the entire engine (for instance, to be friendly
	      on multi-tasking systems).  Suspending the virtual-time clock
	      prevents temporal anomalies from occurring within the engine even
	      though the real-time clock continues to elapse.  An example of a
	      temporal anomaly would be the firing of a missile just prior to
	      suspension of the engine.  Upon engine resumption, if the
	      virtual-time clock was not also suspended, the missile would
	      suddenly jump forward as though much engine time had elapsed.
	    - Updated Apple/NeXT plug-in loading (NeXTLoadLibrary.cpp) to work
	      correctly with new plug-in search-path capabilites.  Also now
	      implements a meaningful csPrintLibraryError()
	    - Enhanced keyboard handling in the MacOS/X Server and OpenStep
	      ports to be compatible with Andrew's National Language Support
	      functionality.  (This feature is not yet fully implemented in the
	      NextStep port.  Doing so requires reverse engineering internal
	      NextStep data structures.)
	    - Implemented F1 - F12 function key translation in MacOS/X Server
	      and OpenStep ports.  (These keys are not yet implemented in the
	      NextStep port.)
	    - csEngineConfig is no longer an inner-class of csEngine.  This
	      change was made in order to work around a bug in the NextStep
	      compiler which was triggered after csObject (from which csEngine
	      inherits) was changed so that it inherits from iObject.  Somehow,
	      the compiler was getting confused by the QueryInterface(),
	      IncRef(), and DecRef() methods declared in csEngineConfig as well
	      as in iEngine and csObject (both of which csEngine inherits
	      from).  Making csEngineConfig stand-alone works around the
	      problem.
	    - In order to work around a multiple-inheritance bug in NextStep
	      compiler, changed the following classes so that they embed an SCF
	      interface rather than inherit from it:
		    iCameraPosition  -> csCameraPosition
		    iMaterialWrapper -> csMaterialWrapper
		    iRegion          -> csRegion
		    iSpriteTemplate  -> csSpriteTemplate
		    iTextureWrapper  -> csTextureWrapper
	      The compiler's symptom was that it did not think that IncRef(),
	      DecRef(), and QueryInterface() were implemented in classes which
	      inherited from iBase multiple times (through different paths).
	      *BEWARE* There were many places where the engine was dangerously
	      and blindly casting pointers between the interface and the
	      implementing class.  For instance, a pointer might be cast from a
	      csMaterialWrapper to an iMaterialWrapper or vice-versa.  Although
	      this worked when the implementing class inherited from the SCF
	      interface, it does _not_ work when the interface is embedded.
	      The danger here is that the compiler does not warn about this
	      problem since it assumes that the programmer knew what he or she
	      was doing when using the cast operation in the first place.  I
	      tried to repair all such broken and dangerous blind casts in
	      which the above classes were involved, but it is possible that I
	      missed one here or there.
	    - Added an assignment operator to ddgTriangle3 in order to appease
	      the NextStep compiler.
	    - Added a missing `inline' keyword to csCovMaskTriage::GetState().
	      The lack of this keyword resulted in this function being
	      implemented and exported from every single source file which
	      included the header.
	    - Unified the case of the `full-screen' extension as understood by
	      iGraphics2D::PerformExtension().  Some canvases expected
	      "fullscreen", whereas others expected "FullScreen".
	    - Added a preprocessor flag to Blocks which allows all of the
	      broken networking code to be disabled in one fell-swoop.
	    - Eliminated compilation warning in pttex.cpp.
	    - Minor modification to csphyzik/entity.h to appease broken
	      OpenStep compiler which wasn't instantiating template methods
	      early enough.  Worked around problem via simple textual
	      reordering of header so that templatized variables are declared
	      before they are actually referenced by inline methods.
	    - Augmented TrueType to CS font converter makfile (csfgen.mak) so
	      that its target only shows up on platforms which also build the
	      TrueType font server plug-in.
	    - Eliminated several compilation warnings in ddgchull.cpp regarding
	      use of enumeral and non-enumeral types in conditional expression.
	    - Added missing SYSDEF_ALLOC define to halogen2.cpp.
	    - Worked around minor compiler bug on NextStep which affected
	      csapp.cpp and txtmgr.cpp.
	    - Eliminated several compilation warnings about "unused computed
	      value" in CSWS and several applications which utilize CSWS, such
	      as cswstest and levtool.
	    - Worked around NextStep compiler limitation in null_pix.cpp and
	      drawpmap.cpp.
	    - 3dsout.cpp now includes cssysdefs.h in order to fake up a `bool'
	      type for compilers which do not support `bool' natively.
	    - Fixed error in me_app.cpp.  Was assinging an
	      mzModificationOriginDepth constant to a csVector3 instance.
	    - imotion.h no longer imports matrix3.h and quaterni.h.
	      iskeleton.h no longer imports transfrm.h.  Not only was this
	      unnecessary, but it also caused csSystemDriver to depend upon
	      these classes on NextStep, which was a less-than-desirable
	      consequence.  This resulted in linkage errors when linking the
	      csSystem library into applications which do not otherwise link
	      with the csGeometry library (such as scfreg).  (This problem is
	      specific to the NextStep compiler which generates references to
	      every mentioned class even if the class isn't actually used.)
	    - All source files in apps/t3d2cs and apps/t3d2cs/libt3d now import
	      cssysdef.h as the very first included file.  This ensures that
	      the `bool' type is faked up, if necessary, before it is used by
	      any other imported headers.
	    - Eliminated an "unused variable" warning in tBrush.cpp.
	    - Worked around a bizarre NextStep compiler bug which manifests as
	      an apparent corruption of the virtual table for csSprite2D.
	      Calls to QueryInterface() from a csSprite2D pointer would never
	      actually invoke the real, inherited csSprite::QueryInterface(),
	      and would instead always return NULL.  It is not even clear
	      which, if any, method was being called in lieu of the real
	      csSprite::QueryInterface().  Calls to QueryInterface() from a
	      local instance of csSprite2D would succeed as expected (since the
	      virtual table is not consulted in this case).  The work around
	      for this problem (for magical reasons) is to declare
	      QueryInterface() in csSprite2D which overrides the inherited
	      csSprite::QueryInterface().  It is sufficient for this method to
	      simply exist in csSprite2D.  Its actual implementation merely
	      invokes its superclass' QueryInterface().

	- Brandon Ehle fixed a quaternion bug, with r initializer in the
	  wrong spot. The motion manager bug was fixed by this and
	  motions now look correct.
	- Started work on csfx library. Not finished yet. The csfx library
	  will contain stuff that is not general enough to be placed in the
	  engine but is general enough to be useful for several games. At
	  first I plan to add some procedural textures (i.e. like fire, water,
	  and plasma from the ptlab demo) and some of the particle systems
	  (like rain, fire, fountain, snow, ...).
	- Eric Sunshine temporarily disabled the sumlog.awk script which
	  performs CVS commit-time mailings.  This was necessary since gawk is
	  not present on the new CVS server which SourceForget installed, thus
	  all invocations of sumlog.awk were failing.
15-Dec-2000
	- Bugfix in csPolygon3D::ClipToPlane(). If the portal has a clipping
	  plane (can happen with floating portals) then it was possible that
	  this clipper would result in badly formed polygons generating
	  crashes or at least render errors in some cases. This problem
	  was visible with the new 'portal' console command. Note that
	  the problem is numerical. I'm not sure that my current fix will
	  eliminate the problem completely but at least I wasn't able to
	  reproduce it anymore.
	- Fixed the portal command so that the created portal always
	  faces the camera (at creation time only). The portal itself also
	  has the correct space warping transformation so that it appears
	  again at the starting point of the loaded world.
	- Changed csCameraPosition so that it inherits from csPObject
	  instead of csObject.
	- Added iCameraPosition and let csCameraPosition inherit from this.
	- Added iRegion/csRegion::FindCameraPosition().
	- Added iEngine/csEngine::FindCameraPosition().
	- csCameraPosition objects are now also supported by csRegion.
	- The portal command now correctly uses the real start position of
	  the loaded level (instead of just room,0,0,0) as given by the
	  'START' command.
	- The portal console command will now check if a region is already
	  loaded. If so then it will just open a new portal to the already
	  existing region.
	- The portal command will now also generate a portal back to the
	  world from which you created a portal. This only happens once though.
	  i.e. if you do 'portal maze' then you will get a portal from the
	  current position towards maze and a portal back from maze towards
	  the current position. If you then move to another position and
	  again do 'portal maze' you will only get a portal to maze and
	  not one back.
	- Renamed WalkTest::InitEngine() to InitCollDet() because that's
	  what it is doing.
	- If a new map file is loaded with the portal command the collision
	  detection stuff will be correctly initialized.
	- Moved the portal so that it is standing on the ground (relative
	  to the position of the player).
	- Known remaining issues with portal command:
	    - If you move through the portal your direction will not be
	      correct. This is caused by WalkTest having its own angle
	      vector which is not yet updated when passing a space
	      warping portal.
	    - If you started WalkTest from flarge (for example) then
	      typing 'portal flarge' will load a new instance. The reason
	      is that the default world is not placed in a region so the
	      portal command can't see that it is already loaded.
	    - Missiles can't penetrate the portal.
	    - Dynamic lights don't shine through the portal.
14-Dec-2000
	- Optimized csRegion::IsInRegion(). Replaced the loop over all
	  the objects in the region with a single test if the parent
	  of the given object is equal to the region.
	- Changed the behaviour of csEngine::FindSector, FindThing, FindSky,
	  FindThingTemplate, FindSprite, FindSpriteTemplate, FindTexture,
	  and FindMaterial. If onlyRegion is false then the behaviour is
	  as before but if onlyRegion is true then these functions will now
	  only return objects that are in the region AND also connected
	  to the engine. This contrasts with the old behaviour where these
	  functions could actually return objects that were not connected
	  to the world (example: do new csSector() and the created sector
	  will automatically be added to the current region, however it will
	  not be added automatically to the list of sectors in the engine).
	  The same functions in csRegion behave like they did before (i.e.
	  they can return objects that are not connected to the engine).
	- The previous change fixes the portal command so that it now
	  correctly loads another world and is able to create a portal to
	  that other world. Note that this doesn't complete the portal
	  command yet. A few extra things need to be done to make it
	  truely usable (initialize collision detection, engine mode
	  specific to sector instead of global to engine).
	- Added a warping transformation to the portal generated by the
	  'portal' command so that the portal destination matches the
	  starting point of the loaded level.
13-Dec-2000
	- Did a little further work on the engine SCF interfaces:
	    - Added iEngine/csEngine::FindTexture().
	    - Added iEngine/csEngine::CreateMaterial().
	    - Added iRegion/csRegion::FindTexture().
	    - Changed FindTexture/FindMaterial to return the pointer
	      to the texture/material on success instead of boolean.
	    - Added iView::Draw().
	    - Moved several defines for vectors in csCamera to iCamera.
	    - Added iEngine::GetBeginDrawFlags().
	    - Added iEngine::CreateLight.
	- The result of the SCF changes today and yesterday is that
	  simplep (the version of simple that uses the engine plugin) is
	  actually able to create geometry and show it.
	- Added iTextureWrapper SCF class and let csTextureWrapper implement
	  it.
	- Made some fixes to cs.i so that the Python plugin is now up-to-date
	  to the latest SCF changes.
12-Dec-2000
	- Thomas Hieber added two files to gamecore plugin which he
	  forgot to add in the past.
	- Michael Dale Long fixed the cctest console. Also did some
	  cosmetic code cleanup. Funky console is now enabled again.
	- Philip Wyett fixed a memory write error in the OpenGL texture
	  cache. This was causing an exit memory write error when exiting
	  'Blocks' in Windows.
	- Rene Dudfield made sprite lighting settings local to sprites so
	  that different sprites can use different settings.
	- Added ShineLights to iRegion/csRegion.
	- Added IsInRegion to iRegion/csRegion to check if some object
	  is in a region.
	- Extended csEngine::ShineLights with an optional csRegion
	  parameter to restrict recalculating lighting for some region.
	- Extended csPolyIt, csCurveIt, and csLightIt (iterators that
	  are defined in csEngine) with an optional csRegion parameter
	  to restrict iteration over the objects in that region.
	  Also extended csEngine::NewPolyIterator() and NewLightIterator()
	  functions.
	- Added GetLastSector() to csCurveIt and csLightIt (like csPolyIt).
	- The 'portal' console command works better now. In some cases
	  it 'almost' seems to be doing what it should. But it is still not
	  good enough. It crashes while trying to load some levels and
	  the portals in the other levels don't seem to be correct.
	  'portal sydney' is the only one which seems to work nicely
	  from flarge.
	- Did a little further work on the engine SCF interfaces:
	    - Added Prepare() to iEngine.
	    - csView now extends the already existing but empty iView.
	    - Added a few methods to iView.
	    - Added CreateView() to iEngine.
	    - Added lots of functions from csCamera to iCamera.
10-Dec-2000
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the project:
	    - Finally eliminated the evil monolithic apps/support/static.cpp
	      file which caused repeated maintenance headaches.  The problem
	      with this file was that every time a plug-in module was added or
	      removed from the project, a developer also had to remember to
	      edit static.cpp to reflect the change.  Thus, the perceived
	      modularity of plug-ins was offset by the very real monolithic
	      disposition of this file.
	    - As a replacement for static.cpp, the new makefile
	      CS/mk/static.mak automatically and dynamically synthesizes C++
	      code which forces hard symbolic references to each plug-in module
	      being linked into the application (assuming that the application
	      is being linked statically---that is, with USE_PLUGINS=no).
	    - Information used by the synthesis process is gleaned from the GNU
	      makefiles, project-wide.  The old CFLAGS.STATIC_SCF makefile
	      variable has been removed.  A new variable, SCF.STATIC, contains
	      a list of plug-in module basenames (such as `soft3d', `vfs',
	      etc.), and this information is used to synthesize the hard
	      references needed when linking applications statically.
	    - The static.mak makefile is smart enough to regenerate the
	      synthesized symbolic references when certain events occur; such
	      as when the user edits the list of plug-in modules in user.mak or
	      reconfigures the project's makefiles.
	    - Note that the new synthesis process is geared toward platforms
	      which utilize the GNU makefile system to build the project.  It
	      does not apply to ports which use `project files'.  However,
	      historically, none of the ports which rely on project files has
	      ever supported static linking, so this is no loss.  If, in the
	      future, a port does wish to support static linking via project
	      files, it would be a simple matter to set up an automated
	      synthesis task, and commit the result to the CVS repository on a
	      regular basis, much as is already done with MSVC project files.
	    - Added $(DEP.EXE) to the dependency lists of the following GUI
	      applications.  This should allow them to successfully link
	      statically (that is, when USE_PLUGINS is `no'):
		cctest
		g2dtest
	    - Removed $(DEP.EXE) from the dependency list of the following
	      console applications, since they need not link against the
	      various plug-in modules:
		csfgen
		makedep
		scfreg
		scftutor
		textconv
		uninst
9-Dec-2000
	- Added 'regionOnly' parameter to all 'FindXxx()' methods in
	  csEngine and iEngine. When this parameter is 'true' (default is
	  'false') only objects in the current region will be searched.
	- Added 'FindSky' to csEngine and iEngine.
	- Added all the 'FindXxx()' methods to csRegion and iRegion as well.
	- In addition added a general 'FindObject()' method to csRegion with
	  which you can find any object of a given name and type.
	- Added csThing::IsSky() which returns true if the thing is a sky
	  object.
	- Added optional is_template parameter to the constructor of csThing.
	  This is just to mark a thing as being a template. Usually this
	  should be set to true if the thing is pushed on the template list
	  in the engine. Also added IsTemplate() function to csThing to
	  query the status of this flag. Modified csLoader to correctly
	  set this flag in the constructor.
	- Added 'FindThingTemplate()' to csEngine, iEngine, csRegion, and
	  iRegion.
	- Added iSprite and iSpriteTemplate SCF classes and let csSprite
	  and csSpriteTemplate implement them. csSprite implements iSprite
	  through embedding (similar to how csThing implements iThing).
	  csSpriteTemplate implements iSpriteTemplate with (multiple)
	  inheritance.
	- Because iSprite is now implemented it is possible to actually
	  implement csRegion and csEngine::FindSprite. In addition because
	  iSpriteTemplate now exists I also added csRegion and csEngine::
	  FindSpriteTemplate. Also added to iRegion and iEngine.
	- Added iObject SCF interface. csObject now implements iObject.
	  iObject is currently almost empty (only contains GetName and
	  SetName). It's main purpose is to allow further definition of the
	  engine SCF interface for all methods that expect or return csObject
	  instances. This rather fundamental change triggered a number of
	  other changes in the engine classes with regards to where they
	  get the iBase implementation. Previously some of those classes
	  implemented iBase for sake of embedding or subclasses. Now, those
	  classes can use the iBase provided by csObject.
	- Fixed a bug in Blocks which caused crashes if no network driver
	  was present. Now it simply doesn't attempt to open a connection
	  if there is no network driver.
	- Implemented 'onlyRegion' support in csLoader by using the new
	  FindXxx() routines that were added to csEngine.
	- Extended csPObject thus that it correctly unlinks itself from its
	  parent at destruction time. Previously it didn't care which could
	  cause bad problems.
	- Also fixed csObject::ObjRelease() so that it actually resets the
	  parent to NULL at release time.
	- In addition fixed the csObject destructor so that the children
	  are destroyed the correct way now (given that destroying a child
	  will automatically remove it from the 'children' array).
	- The csObjectNoDel destructor has also been fixed so that it
	  sets the parent of all children to NULL (since they are now
	  unlinked).
	- All engine classes that can be added to a region now extend
	  csPObject instead of csObject. This is to make sure that they
	  actually maintain the parent (which is the region they are in).
	  When such an object is then deleted it will safely unlink itself
	  from the parent (region).
	- Added iRegion/csRegion::PrepareTextures() to prepare all textures
	  and materials that were loaded in the context of this region.
	- Renamed iRegion::Prepare() to PrepareSectors() and added a new
	  Prepare() which calls PrepareTextures() followed by PrepareSectors().
	  This way it works more like csEngine does.
	- All the above changes done today result in the 'portal' console
	  command not crashing anymore and loading the world given as a
	  parameter (probably) correctly in a new region. The 'portal' command
	  still doesn't work though because something is still wrong with
	  the portal.
8-Dec-2000
	- Samuel Humphreys did the following changes to phyztest:
	    - First stage of reformatting csphyziks to be more consistent
	      with itself and the Crystal Space style.
	    - Fixed the dissappearing block in phyztest..thx to Michaels
	      guidance.
	    - Added reportage of the main variables associated with the
	      block object.
	    - Changed the room to be a cube of 10 units each side centred
	      on the origin.
	- Samuel also fixed the bot cam so that it can traverse into the
	  new room of visual feasts (plasma, water, and fire).
	- Fixed a bug in cs.i for python. Eric Sunshine accidentally removed
	  the essential '3' after csVector3 :-)
	- Eric Sunshine moved command.cpp and command.h from apps/support to
	  apps/walktest since these files are only used by WalkTest. Updated
	  makefile and other source files to reflect this change.
	- Martin Geisse added a missing lib in the ds3d makefile.
	- Norman Kramer added missing include to a file in MazeD.
	- Wouter Wijngaards improved fire a bit. You can now show single
	  flames as well as a tiling wall of flame. Also added water and
	  plasma textures (all viewable in ptlab).
7-Dec-2000
	- Wouter Wijngaards made the fire polygon unlit in ptlab. This
	  looks better.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes:
	    - Renamed the following classes and SCF interfaces.  Fixed all
	      source files, header files, and documentation to reflect these
	      changes.
		    iWorld --> iEngine
		    csWorld --> csEngine
		    csWorldConfig --> csEngineConfig
		    csWorldState --> csEngineState
		    csWorldStateVector --> csEngineStateVector
	    - Renamed the following files.  Fixed all source files, header
	      files, and documentation to reflect these changes.
		    iworld.h --> iengine.h
		    world.h --> engine.h
		    world.cpp --> engine.cpp
		    worldfmt.txi --> mapfmt.txi
	    - Eliminated the old iEngine SCF interface and the iengine.h header
	      file.  This interface was just a very thin wrapper around the
	      existing iWorld (now iEngine) functionality.  However, since the
	      engine library already contains sufficient SCF goop to pass as a
	      plug-in module, the old thin iEngine wrapper was not actually
	      needed.  The new iEngine is now the one and only interface for
	      accessing the engine regardless of whether or not it is in a
	      plug-in module or statically linked.  There is no longer any
	      distinction.
	    - Renamed all `world' variables to 'engine' throughout the project
	      and documentation.  Renamed all variations of `world' (such as
	      `World', etc.), as well.  Also renamed `world file' references to
	      `map file' references.  Code and documentation which specifically
	      refers to `world space' or `world coordinates' has not changed.
	      In this case, the `world' terminology is appropriate and has been
	      retained.
	    - Added a bunch of missing `const' qualifiers to Dumper class.
	    - Renamed Dungeon plug-in's SCF name from
	      crystalspace.worldrnd.dungeon.std to crystalspace.dungeon.random.
	    - csProgressPulse now uses iSystem::Printf() rather than
	      CsPrintf(), thus it is no longer tied to the engine.  Also added
	      Doxygen comments.
	    - Enhanced the check for new C++ casting syntax in comptest.sh to
	      be more thorough.  It now checks for all casting variations.
	      This was necessary, since someone at NeXT botched the OpenStep
	      Objective-C++ compiler so that it fails to understand
	      reinterpret_cast even though it understands static_cast,
	      const_cast, and dynamic_cast.
	    - Eliminated compilation warning in csbaglay.cpp regarding one
	      variable shadowing another.
	    - NeXT csosdefs.h now defines __NEED_GENERIC_ISDIR for SYSDEF_DIR
	      so that the generic isdir() gets defined.  This is now required
	      by CSWS.
	    - Added missing `const' qualifier to SetName() and GetName()
	      methods of csFrame and csSpriteAction.
	    - Eliminated several compilation warnings from the sound loader
	      plug-in.
	    - Eliminated compilation warning about redefinition of RED_PREPROC
	      macro in haloscan.inc.  This warning only showed up on platforms
	      which have TOP8BITS_R8G8B8_USED defined.
	    - Eliminated several compilation warnings in g2dtest regarding
	      implicit conversion of float to int.
	    - Added missing `const' qualifiers to several methods in
	      mz3DSprite.
	    - Fixed quite a lot of multiple-include protection macros in
	      include/csengine so that they are now prefixed by `CS' (for
	      instance __CS_STATS_H__ rather than STATS_H).  This should help
	      to avoid naming collisions with non-CS packages.
	    - Eliminated compilation warning in ptlab.cpp.
	    - Eliminated compilation warning in dnfnodes.cpp.
6-Dec-2000
	- Fixed a comment in iGraphics2D.
	- Extend csObject::GetChild() with a new 'derived' parameter similar
	  to how GetIterator() works. With 'derived' set to true GetChild()
	  will return the first child that matches the type or is a type
	  derived from the given type. To get the first child you can now
	  use GetChild (csObject::Type, true);
	- Added iRegion SCF interface which csRegion extends.
	- Extended iWorld and csWorld with SelectRegion and GetCurrentRegion.
	- More work on csRegion class. DeleteAll(), Clear(), and Prepare()
	  should all work now. But untested at the moment.
	- All objects that should belong to a region will now add themselves
	  to the current region automatically.
	- Added new 'REGION' keyworld to WORLD in loader. This keyworld
	  will create/select a new region and all subsequent sectors,
	  collections, sprite templates or thing templates, will be added
	  to that region. If the name of the region is empty then the default
	  NULL region will be used. Note that it is possible to interleave
	  region selection. For example, you can first create a few sectors
	  in region 'east', followed by a few sectors in region 'west',
	  followed again by a few sectors in region 'east'.
	- Fixed a bug in csWorld::CreateThing(). This function accidently
	  added the thing twice to the list of things for every sector (once
	  by doing SetSector on the movable and once explicit). In addition
	  this routine forgot to add the thing to the list of things in the
	  world.
	- Added 'portal' console command to WalkTest. This will create a new
	  region with the given name and load the same named level into
	  that region. Then it will create a portal on the spot you are
	  standing to the start position of the new level. For example,
	  you can do 'portal maze' to load maze.zip into the 'maze' region.
	  Then you can enter 'maze.zip' through the new portal :-)
	  WARNING! This command does not work at the moment and the only
	  effect is crashing WalkTest! Work in Progress!
	- Added csLoader::AppendWorldFile() which will load a world
	  file without first clearing the original world.
	- Added a parameter 'onlyRegion' to AppendWorldFile(). If true then
	  then portals will only connect to the sectors in the current
	  region, things will only use thing templates defined in the
	  current region and sprites will only use sprite templates
	  defined in the current region.
	- Small fix in OpenGL which SHOULD support alpha for DrawPixmap
	  but for some reason doesn't.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed unixconf.sh so that it respects the CXX setting
	  from the environment if such a setting already exists, rather than
	  completely ignoring such a setting.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed some problems in cspython.mak and csjava.mak.
	- Eric Sunshine added automatic detection of SVGALIB to unixconf.sh.
	- Eric Sunshine removed the dead cygnus.mak makefile.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated several compilation warnings from
	  crysball.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine added missing RequestPlugin(FontServer) to simplep.cpp.
	- Samuel Humphreys added a fire procedural texture to ptlab. The fire
	  algorithm was contributed by Wouter Wijngaards.
	- Martin Geisse fixed a bug which caused the sound modules to ignore
	  some config settings.
5-Dec-2000
	- Wouter Wijngaards created csBox3::SquaredOriginDist which returns
	  a float with the squared distance of the box to (0,0,0). It
	  is extremely fast (algo taken from sector.cpp).
	- Norman Kramer did the following changes:
	    - Catched a div by zero in LOD calc for sprites.
     	    - Sprites are now clipped if shortest distance is greater than
	      D() value of the farplane (squared version).
	- Started work on csRegion class. Not functional at the moment.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes:
	    - Removed all platform-specific specializations from of csdef.h.
	      These specializations have been moved to platform-specific
	      makefiles and include files, where appropriate.  The idea here is
	      to eliminate the mentality of monolithicism by moving as much
	      platform-specific goop into platform-specific configuration files
	      rather than polluting generalized project resources with
	      platform-specific crud.
	    - Moved all OS_NEXT-specific specializations out of csdef.h and
	      into next/csosdefs.h.
	    - csdef.h is no longer responsible for setting the OS_UNIX flag for
	      Solaris, Linux, Irix, BSD, BeOS, NeXT, and PS2.  It is now the
	      responsibility of each platform's makefile to set the OS_UNIX
	      flag, instead, if that designation is appropriate for the given
	      platform.
	    - Upgraded volatile.mak so that it has an understanding of
	      operating system `families', such as Unix, Win32, etc.  If it
	      sees that a platform-specific makefile has designated itself as
	      belonging to a particular family, then volatile.mak includes an
	      appropriate definition (such as OS_UNIX) in volatile.h.  All
	      platform-specific makefiles which require OS_UNIX now obtain it
	      via the new `family' mechanism.
	    - Added comptest.sh which tests for different compiler capabilities
	      at project configuration time.  Both unixconf.sh and next.mak now
	      invoke comptest.sh.
	    - Merged booltest.sh into comptest.sh.  Removed booltest.sh.
	    - Added a compiler capability test for new-style C++ casting syntax
	      to comptest.sh.  If the compiler does not understand this syntax,
	      then the makefile variable CS_USE_OLD_STYLE_CASTS is defined.
	      volatile.mak then defines the preprocessor variable
	      CS_USE_OLD_STYLE_CASTS which is recognized by csdef.h.
	    - Added a compiler capability test for the new C++ `explicit'
	      keyword.  If the compiler does not understand this keyword, then
	      the makefile variable CS_USE_FAKE_EXPLICIT_KEYWORD is defined.
	      volatile.mak then defines the preprocessor variable
	      CS_USE_FAKE_EXPLICIT_KEYWORD which is recognized by csdef.h.
	    - Renamed makefile and preprocessor variables DO_FAKE_BOOL to
	      CS_USE_FAKE_BOOL_TYPE.
	    - Renamed makefile and preprocessor variables DO_FAKE_SOCKLEN_T to
	      CS_USE_FAKE_SOCKLEN_TYPE.
	    - Moved initial definition of MAKE_VOLATILE_H out of Makefile and
	      into volatile.mak.
	    - Reworked the STATIC_CAST, DYNAMIC_CAST, REINTERPRET_CAST, and
	      CONST_CAST macros so that the user is no longer responsible for
	      remembering to add extra parentheses around the expression which
	      is being casted.
	    - Eliminated Linux-specific specializations from makedep/parse.cpp.
	    - Eliminated NextStep-specific specializations from bspbox.cpp.
	    - Eliminated platform-specific specializations from scf.h and moved
	      them into the appropriate platform-specific csosdefs.h files.  In
	      particular, the Windows, BeOS, and OS/2 configuration files now
	      override the default function export mechanism rather than
	      hard-coding such platform-specific knowledge into SCF.
	    - Created include/cssys/csosdefs.h which takes over the
	      responsibility of including the platform-specific csosdefs.h from
	      cssysdef.h.  This helps to remove some platform-specific
	      specialization from cssysdef.h.
	    - Eliminated all platform-specific specializations from version.h.
	      It is now the responsibility of the platform-specific makefile
	      and project files to provide this information on behalf of
	      version.h.  The idea here is to eliminate the mentality of
	      monolithicism and promote the concept of modularity, rather than
	      polluting generalized project resources, such as version.h, with
	      platform-, processor-, and compiler-specific crud.  For all
	      platforms which use the GNU makefile system, this information is
	      now provided automatically by volatile.mak by gleaning the
	      necessary information from the existing GNU makefiles.  In
	      particular, volatile.mak examines the makefile variables
	      $(DESCRIPTION.$(TARGET)), $(PROC), and $(COMP) in order to
	      provide useful human-readable information to version.h.
	    - Renamed the following preprocessor identifiers from version.h
	      (some of which are now defined by platform-specific project files
	      rather than being defined directly in version.h):
		CS_VERSION    --> CS_VERSION_MAJOR
		CS_SUBVERSION --> CS_VERSION_MINOR
		VERSION       --> CS_VERSION
		RELEASE_DATE  --> CS_RELEASE_DATE
		OS_VERSION    --> CS_PLATFORM_NAME
		PR_VERSION    --> CS_PROCESSOR_NAME
		CC_VERSION    --> CS_COMPILER_NAME
	    - Renamed the plug-in file extension for MacOS/X Server, OpenStep,
	      and NextStep from .dylib to .csplugin.
	    - Added general/findlib.cpp to SRC.SYS_CSSYS in next.mak.
4-Dec-2000
	- Norman Kramer implemented farplane culling for sprites.
	- Added 'sndload' to the 'walkall' target because without the
	  sound loader WalkTest will not run.
	- Fixed a number of compile errors that trigger with VC5.
3-Dec-2000
	- Norman Kramer did some work on CrystalBall (his polygon culler).
	- Norman also did the following with relation to the c-buffer
	  culler:
	    - GetConvexOutline (in csBox) has a new parameter: bVisisble.
              If true it returns all visible corners, if not then just
	      the outline.
	    - The farplane is now recognized in the octree culling and
	      polygon culling process.
	- Noah L. Gibbs added support for change to libs/csphyzik/qtrbconn.cpp.
	  Also some prototypes for new functions. Here is the comment:
	      Checking in code that's almost enough to make the rigid-body
	      connectors useful. They now successfully take derivatives of
	      an arbitrary point and its velocity on the rigid body with
	      respect to all state variables of that body -- except for the
	      derivative of the velocity with respect to the rigid body's
	      angular momentum.  Ouch.  Working on it.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the documentation:
	    - Fixed several Texinfo mark-up problems in msdos.txi, win32.txi,
	      win32gcc.txi, 
	    - Performed some re-writing and clean-up of features.txi.
	    - Performed some minor reformatting of csgeom.txi, graphics.txi,
	      and plugins/overview.txi.
	    - Performed some minor re-writing of cssys.txi.
	    - Replaced Doc++ references with Doxygen references in coding.txi.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to CVSROOT/sumlog.awk (and
	    cousins):
	    - Minor beautification of generated output in order to facilitate
	      ease of reading.
	    - Now ensures that all developers have write access to temporary
	      working directory.  This should prevent the problem of
	      "permission denied" errors which occurred for some users when
	      committing files.
	- Eric Sunshine added missing FontPlex registration to static.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed copy/paste error in fontplex.mak.
	- Eric Sunshine removed references to the obsolete and long dead
	  Amiga and Watcom ports.
	- Eric Sunshine removed the following modules and resources from the
	  project.  Also removed all references to these modules from
	  documentation, source and header files, configuration files, etc.
	  All removed resources were tagged with the name "PURGE_1" just before
	  being purged to CVS's "Attic".  This tag may be used to easily
	  recover any module or resource back to the state it was in just prior
	  to removal.

2-Dec-2000
	- Seth Galbraith did the following changes to sprites:
	    - Automatic level-of-detail adjustment based on distance and
	      field-of-view.
	    - cfg_lod_detail (the "lod" setting in Walktest) is now
	      basically the distance at which full detail is visible
	      instead of a fractional value.
	- Seth also added -mconsole to the linking flags for win32gcc.mak.
          He also added comments explaining what to expect if you
	  comment-out the -mconsole option.
	- Wouter Wijngaards improved WalkTest as follows:
	    - Finetuned the parameters for the 'flame' demo particle system.
	      It looks better now, less blocky.
	    - Removed those irritating 1 pixel wide margins where pixels
	      from the console text could still be seen. At the end of
	      initialize, ClearAll() is called.
1-Dec-2000
	- Andrew Zabolotny tried to fix OpenGL library problems.
	  LIBS.OPENGL.SYSTEM is now the correct variable to define the
	  system libraries for OpenGL support. For example (in system
	  makefile or in config.mak):
	    LIBS.OPENGL.SYSTEM=-L/usr/local/include/MesaGL -lMesaGL
