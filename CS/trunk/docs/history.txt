The history order is reversed so that new features are at the top.

24-May-2001
	- Eric Sunshine fixed several problems in lexan.mak.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated compilation warning from csobject.cpp about
	  csObjectIterator having virtual functions but non-virtual destructor.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated compilation warning about implicit
	  declaration of strncmp() in NeXTMenu.m on MacOS/X.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed several compilation errors on big-endian
	  platforms in wavefile.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated several compilation warnings about unused
	  variables in wavefile.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated several compilation warnings from NeXTView.m
	  and NeXTDelegate2D.m by including needed header files on MacOS/X.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated several compilation warnings from
	  inf_g3d.cpp regarding mismatch of printf() format directive and
	  incoming argument.  The warnings were caused by different definitions
	  of cs_time on various platforms.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated several compilation warnings in bmptest.cpp
	  regarding unused variables.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed map2cs so that it uses the portable strcasecmp()
	  rather than the unportable stricmp().
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a compilation warning in demoop.cpp caused
	  by mismatch of printf() format directive and incoming argument.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a compilation warning from cthing.cpp
	  regarding unused variable.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a compilation error recently introduced into
	  bumptest.cpp where the type iTextureWrapper was unknown.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed several compilation errors recently introduced
	  into demosky.cpp where iGraphics2D was unknown.
23-May-2001
	- Added 'virtual' before the csView destructor and also fixed a
	  warning in the csView constructor.
	- Fixed a warning in csLightMap.
	- Fixed a compile error in map2cs.
	- Improved OpenGL super-lightmap handling a little. If there is
	  no more room in the current super-lightmap it will try the
	  two older ones first before creating a new super-lightmap. This
	  should improve usage of the super-lightmaps a little.
	- Added new Video.OpenGL.FpsLimit config for OpenGL with which you
	  can artificially decrease FPS speed. This is useful on some cards
	  where very high framerates actually cause congestion in the OpenGL
	  queue (or something like that) and slowing down helps to get
	  smoother results. This is disabled by default.
	- Made the number of super-lightmaps configurable (default is still
	  10). Also made the size configurable (default 256). The options
	  are Video.OpenGL.SuperLightMapNum and Video.OpenGL.SuperLightMapSize.
	  Note that the super-lightmap size will automatically be capped
	  to the maximum allowed texture size. So you can safely set it
	  to 10000000x10000000 :-) Also note that this size should be a power
	  of two.
	- I have been told that state changes in OpenGL are expensive.
	  So I started implementing buffering on state changes and indeed
	  it seems to improver performance a bit even by doing
	  only simple changes. At this moment only the z-buffer state
	  is cached like this.
22-May-2001
	- Implemented improved OpenGL lightmap cache. There is now the notion
	  of a super-lightmap which is a collection of smaller lightmaps.
	  At this moment there are 10 super lightmaps of 256x256. In the
	  future this will be configurable. Even though the engine currently
	  does not sort on lightmap yet, there is already a performance
	  improvement. Because of this change the OpenGL renderer no longer
	  requires that lightmaps are converted to power of two dimensions.
	  This is not needed since the lightmaps are now put in a larger
	  texture. This saves a lot of space too. For example, if you would
	  have a 33x33 lightmap then the old OpenGL renderer would convert
	  this to a 64x64 lightmap. This is nearly four times too big!
	  At this moment there is still some waste though. This is caused
	  by the (currently unoptimized) csSubRectangles class.
	- Apparently not all OpenGL drivers correctly support glTexImage2D
	  with a NULL pointer as input data. OpenGL specs say this is allowed.
	  So I added a work-around for this by giving a dummy array.
	- Wouter Wijngaards added some code in the Print method to delay
	  (using System Sleep()). This is needed for a G400. It needs a
	  limit of 50 fps. (which is a 40 msec setting, probably due to
	  bad timers/sleep inaccuracy). This code is currently disabled.
	  A config option needs to be made to enable this optionally.
	- Lightmaps are now sorted on lightmap. Every super lightmap has
	  its own cache and they are rendered one by one when needed.
	- Fog has its own seperate queue now and this is rendered in a
	  totally seperate pass.
	- Martin Geisse continued cleanup of the engine.
	- Thomas Hieber updated map2cs again. Still not completely ready
	  though.
	- Michael Knorr (damage-list@freenet.de) by way of Thomas Hieber
	  fixed curve handling in map2cs (for the new map format).
	- Norman Kramer did some fixing to the new aRts sound renderer.
21-May-2001
	- Added non-functional emit loader/saver which Wouter can complete.
	- Wouter worked on emit loader. I did a small enhancement too.
	- Finished the first version of csSubRectangles. It seems to work
	  now so it is ready for using in the lightmap combination code.
	  Note however that the algorithm used in csSubRectangles is not
	  very sophisticated. It is a start to see how far we go. Optimization
	  can come later.
	- Wouter Wijngaards made a new particle systems demo level in cvs.
	- Wouter also did several fixes to the emit particle system including
	  an unititialized variable. Also it would not function correctly
	  with very low fps.
	- Wouter Fixed a bug in spiral particle system. It forgot to do
	  SetNumber(max) on the Newtonian parent system.
	- Martin Geisse committed a remake of the WAV loader by
	  Andreas Höfler.
	- Norman Kramer added missing CSGEOM to link with glx2d.
20-May-2001
	- Philip Wyett started a big overhaul of CS/Visual C++ docs.
	- Wouter Wijngaards added an emittor particle system. This is a very
	  configurable particle system. It has the following options:
	    - You can set the particle start position, start speed, start
	      accel from a host of generation functions.
	    - During the lifetime of the particle, the color, alpha,
	      swirlyness of movement, rotationspeed and scale are animated.
	      These values are interpolated from given values.
	    - You can specify an attractor for the particles. Particles tend
	      to go towards the attractor point. The attractor point is
	      gotten per particle. You can also use a NULL attractor - none
	      will be used.
	    - The bounding box of the system is now pretty smart - each time
	      a particle is started or moves, the bbox is updated.
	    - You can use either rectangular sprite2ds or you can use regular
	      shaped (n-sided) sprite2ds with this particle system.
	  This particle system should be able to also do the behaviour of
	  the fountain, rain, snow, fire and explosion particle systems.
	  (But those are probably a little more efficient at what they do).
	- Norman Kramer added a sound renderer using the artsd soundserver
	  that comes with the aRts system (see www.arts-project.org). This
	  is not operational yet (well at one point the tt testprogram worked,
	  but after an evening full of moving code back and forth im sure it
	  wont now).
19-May-2001
	- Moved csRect from csutil to csgeom. First I believe it belongs
	  there, and secondly I need csRect for another new class that
	  I'm going to put in csgeom.
	- Started new csSubRectangles class. This class represents a region
	  from which you can allocate smaller rectangles until the region is
	  empty. This class is going to be used for combining lightmaps
	  efficiently into a bigger texture (OpenGL). It is currently not
	  operational yet.
18-May-2001
	- Since the new lightmap format seems to work well I removed the
	  optional support for the old format.
	- Did yet another optimization in the OpenGL renderer. When dynamic
	  lighting modifies a lightmap no new texture will be generated but
	  instead the old cached lightmap state will be reused (using
	  glTexSubImage2D).
	- Philip Wyett updated map2cs tutorial with path to cstex_1.wad.
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed texture generation to be sure of good
	  computation (made constant a float instead of int).
	- Wouter also fixed the slopefunction so it now is much more robust
	  in several respects. The values it returns can be pretty large,
	  say in 0.. 4xterrainheight or so.
	- Wouter fixed procedural water, so that it will look nice in
	  software mode. No more pixelized look. By removing the
	  proc.texture.only flag.
	- Thomas Hieber made the output format of map2cs even better.
	  (but Walktest still decides to crash when loading).
17-May-2001
	- Fixed Blocks so it compiles again.
	- Did an experimental optimization. CS will now keep the lightmap
	  in another format which is more suitable for hardware. Instead
	  of three seperate maps of red, green, and blue data we now have
	  r,g,b,0 in one array. Disadvantage: 4 bytes per lightmap entry
	  instead of 3. Advantage: no more need to convert the lightmap
	  in OpenGL as this format can be used like that. This gives a speed
	  up which is especially visible if there are dynamic lights and
	  you are moving a lot (and there are lots of lightmaps). Otherwise
	  it will not give a slow-down.
	  The new format can be turned off by setting NEW_LM_FORMAT to 0
	  in iengine/lightmap.h.
	  WARNING! Lightmaps will have to be relalculated (-relight).
	- Removed a bunch of code in OpenGL lightmap handling which used
	  to be needed but now I can't see a difference in visual output.
	  The code is between #if 0/#endif so I can revert if needed.
	- Implemented a lot of new functionality from the new texture
	  generation tool. Will write some documentation on this later.
	  A new version of newsky.zip is required!
	- Eric Sunshine applied an interim solution to the problem with the
	  "extensive debug" facility breaking builds on certain platforms.
	  In particular, this facility breaks compilation on platforms which
	  define their own custom operator `new' overloads.  The extensive
	  debug facility can now be disabled on a platform-by-platform basis
	  and is now disabled, by default, on BeOS.
	- Thomas Hieber did a little bit more work on map2cs. It now starts
	  to look ok but walktest still crashes on it.
16-May-2001
	- Philip Wyett did a quick update to eliminate 3000 compiler warnings.
	  Pragma'ed C4291 out, for time being, will come back to this.
	- Fixed a bad bug with lazy clipping in the OpenGL DrawTriangleMesh
	  implementation. This would cause crashes on some cards (like ATI).
	- OpenGL::DrawPolygonFX will now also use the DrawPolygon queue.
	  This makes the code a lot simpler and also a lot faster if
	  multiple texture passes are used (gouraud shading, fog, multiple
	  texture layers). If only one pass is used the overhead of the
	  queue makes DPFX slightly slower.
	- Removed OpenGL::RealStartPolygonFX.
	- Wouter Wijngaards did a zoomy whoomy change of terrain image
	  generator. Now all the components, textures, functions, blending
	  can be mixed and matches as you like, to create all sort of nice
	  effects. Like: splotches of a texture irrespective of terrain
	  height. (for roads and so on).
	  Also slopes could be used, perhaps even blended with height-mapped
	  terrain image.
	- Fixed csparser so that it works with the new API of the
	  terrain generator but the new features are not yet supported.
	- Philip Wyett did a bug fix to the OpenGL Canvas for Windows:
	  Changed default Window style for windowed apps.
	  This fixes the seeing of a nasty little 2 pixel black
	  border at top and right side of window in apps like
	  csdemo.
	- Fixed a bug with the terrain heightmap function not being completely
	  correct. This fixes both collision detection (i.e. walking on the
	  terrain which used to be very bumpy) as well as texture mapping
	  using the texture generation process.
	- Added a new subsection to all howto's giving a short summary of
	  the relevant include files for the example code in that section.
	- Fixed a bug in csThing (creation of bounding box) which was
	  harmless but nevertheless it did cause an assert to fail
	  (and rightly so).
	- Thomas Hieber writes the following: tried to get map2cs to work
	  with the new map format, but I really have the impression, the new
	  map format was designed for obscurity. My head is now buzzing with
	  meshfactories and plugins and all that stuff. To make it short:
	  I am giving up on it. I have committed my effort in the hope there
	  is somebody out there who understands the new map format and can
	  fix it. At least my changes to the material stuff and the plane
	  stuff seem reasonable.
	  I also output the "plugins" section right so maybe this is a start.
	  I don't have a clue, how to convert bezier curves. I have put
	  everything together on curves that I thought I had understood,
	  but maybe I am wrong there.
	  Sectors and things are a lot more difficult. I don't know how to
	  connect polygons to texture planes, and all the stuff with these
	  factories and parts is over my head.
	  I don't think the old format of CS map files was easy to
	  understand, but the new format is much more complicated.
	  At least to complicated for me.
	- Norman Kramer writes: years after Raider was renamed to Twix I
	  now renamed MESHOBJ to MESHFACT in the meshobj documentation.
	- Martin Geisse added a generic 'string set' utility class. Its
	  functionality is the same as of the string server plug-in.
	- Martin also did a bugfix to the material code.
15-May-2001
	- Philip Wyett added the new cslexan to global build process.
	  Philip also changed MSVC project file generation process to create
	  project files with a higher internal VC compiler warning flag.
	- Added some code to cssysdef.h which will enable a memory debugger
	  to get more information (file name and line number). Enabling
	  this requires that operator new (and new[]) are overloaded with
	  two additional parameters. csutil/memdebug.cpp contains such
	  operators. The memory debugger can be enabled with
	  CS_EXTENSIVE_MEMDEBUG. This flag is disabled by default in
	  optimize mode and enabled in debug mode. If CS_EXTENSIVE_MEMDEBUG
	  is enabled while the memory debugger is not, the memory debugger
	  will still provide the needed overloaded operators so you can
	  leave CS_EXTENSIVE_MEMDEBUG on safely.
	- Greatly extended the memory debugger. It now keeps track
	  of much more information and it can also (optionally) keep track
	  of deleted memory to see if it is later used again. Of course this
	  slows down CS a huge amount.
	- Fixed a potential memory overwrite bug in csThing with the cam_verts
	  array. I think that this might be THE bug I have been hunting for
	  a few days. Thanks to the new memory debugger! :-)
14-May-2001
	- Fixed a bug in csShadowBlock, why doesn't a compiler warn on stupid
	  assignments like 'a=a'? There is a very small chance that this
	  fix may fix the dynamic lighting bug I'm experiencing. Not sure
	  though. UPDATE: it didn't :-(.
	- Put in lots of sanity checks in csShadowBlock and related classes.
	  Also lots of CS_ASSERT calls.
	- Added support for KEY keyword in loader for lights.
	- Added new cmd_AnimateDynLight which will animate a pseudo-dynamic
	  light.
	- Added new cmd_AnimateDynLight to flarge to test this.
	- Added new id's to csLight to solve a problem with lightmap saving
	  (for pseudo-dynamic lights).
	- Changed csEngine::FindCsLight() to work with this new ID instead
	  of the CS_ID. Also changed csSector::FindLight().
	- The two changes above fix a bug with pseudo-dynamic lights not
	  loading correctly.
	- Fixed a bug with pseudo-dynamic lights not setup correctly if
	  the lighting is recalculated (i.e. not read from lm cache).
	- Started new doc for api modifications from 0.18 to 0.19. Far from
	  finished though.
	- Worked a bit on the howto section again. Added section about pixmaps.
	  Completed section about level loading.
	- Removed StartPolygonFX and FinishPolygonFX completely. Only
	  the glide and Direct3D renderers are not updated. For now just call
	  DrawPolygonFX(). That function is itself responsible for testing
	  it texture information needs to be updated or not.
	- csEngine::CreateSectorWallsMesh() will put the created mesh in
	  the 'wall' render priority queue now.
	- Further updated apimod19.txi.
	- Added HOWTO on render priorities.
	- Michael Voasse did the following changes to the motion system:
	    - Made the motion loader a plugin.
	    - Fixed a malloc/realloc bug in motion.cpp.
	    - Fixed a small memory leak in csMotion.
	    - Did a fix to keep bone transforms.
	- Martin Geisse did some cleanup of the material wrapper code.
	- Christopher Nelson updated the lexical analyzer definition,
	  changed the iString's to csString's since they aren't
	  interchangeable currently.
	- Christopher also implemented the lexical analyzer's VM (mostly).
	  Currently missing features are:
	    - custom table matching ([a-z] or [bfsf] etc.)
	    - implementation of push and pop stream currently does nothing.
	    - implementation of match currently does not call Exec().
13-May-2001
	- Added CS_ASSERT to some of the functions in growing arrays to
	  make sure we catch those kinds of errors early.
	- Norman Kramer fixed simplep for Martin's changes yesterday.
	- Michael Voase added APPLY_MOTION to spr3dldr.cpp. Modified
	  walktest.cfg to correctly load motion manager.
	- Removed all 'friend' declarations (except Dumper) from
	  csLightPatch. Instead added SetPolyCurve(), AddPolyList(),
	  AddLightList(), RemoveLightList(), SetLightFrustum(), and
	  GetLightFrustum(). Added a few CS_ASSERT's again.
	- Added some CS_ASSERT's to various classes in csgeom.
	- Added CS_ASSERT to dynamic light calculation code.
	- Martin Geisse changed bumptest to use the engine as a plugin.
	- Martin cleaned up the code for csMaterial and csTextureWrapper.
12-May-2001
	- Thanks to Philip Wyett I fixed a bad bug in the OpenGL
	  software clipper. Some arrays were not correctly sized to the
	  number of clipped vertices (which could be more than the
	  number of vertices). It now seems to work ok.
	- Martin Geisse moved csLight accessor functions from csDynLight
	  to csLight. They belong there, even if they are useless for
	  static lights. Added missing accessor functions. Changed Blocks
	  in several cases to use the engine through interfaces.
	- Christopher Nelson added Dynamic Lexical Analyzer interface
	  definition file.
	- Christopher also added base regular expression and regular
	  expression compiler objects (new cslexan plugin).
	- Martin Geisse moved textrans.cpp (.h) from csengine to csgeom.
	- Martin did further work on engine interface and Blocks.
	  Removed SetPosition() from iCamera because direct access
	  to the transform should be used.
	- Philip Wyett fixed bad bug in GL renderer.
	  "uv_mul_verts.SetLimit (num_vertices);"
	  to update of work table(s) at line: 2302
	  This was done because a crash out occurred at
	  line: 2599, when variable "uv_mul_verts" accesses
	  "GetArray ()".
11-May-2001
	- Added additional HOWTO sections.
	- Moved the FOG constants from OpenGL to ivideo/graph3d.h. They
	  are general enough for any hardware accelerated fog implementation.
	- Fixed fog in OpenGL. It now works again. For some reason it got
	  broken. It is also faster (since no fog array needs to be copied
	  anymore) and it uses less memory.
	- Added a 'name' parameter to iEngine::CreateLight().
	- Added GetLastAnimationTime() to csEngine.
	- Removed csMeshWrapper::NextFrame(). csMeshWrapper will now use
	  the last animation time from the engine to automatically detect
	  if meshobj->NextFrame() has to be called. This is an optimization.
	- Put 'mixmode' in G3DPolygonDPFX for DrawPolygonFX. This is in
	  preparation for the removal of StartPolygonFX and FinishPolygonFX.
	- Removed the support for Shortcut routines in OpenGL renderer. It
	  was not used and did not work anyway.
	- Fixed a memory leak in the software clipper used in OpenGL.
	- Fixed a bug with the software clipper in OpenGL with meshes that
	  resulted in no triangles after clipping.
	- Fixed a bug with the software clipper in OpenGL. It would not
	  clip correctly for meshes that were already transformed by the
	  engine (this can happen for skeletal sprites).
	- Fixed two small bugs in csEngine::Draw() and csEngine::DrawFunc().
	- StartPolygonFX and FinishPolygonFX in OpenGL are now empty.
	  DrawPolygonFX will automatically detect the need for doing
	  initialization.
	- Fixed a very small robustness bug in the lighting code.
	- Fixed a bug in OpenGL renderer. The ref count of rgba_verts
	  was not properly incremented.
10-May-2001
	- Fixed a bug in clipper detection for OpenGL. In some cases it
	  would select 'N' for the required clipper which is not allowed.
	- Renamed the VERY old Sparse3D and WideSparse3D classes to conform
	  to CS coding guidelines (i.e. csSparse3D and csWideSparse3D) and
	  also made the functions start with a capital letter.
	- Fixed a bug in the new software OpenGL clipper (in csFrustum/
	  ClipToPlane). It now seems to work perfectly in all cases as far
	  as I can see.
	- Added code to save the result of auto-detection (OpenGL renderer).
	  The result of this test is saved in user.cfg. I had hoped to save
	  it with 'Global' put in front so that the test results would work
	  for all apps but at this moment they are saved with the app prefix.
	  This means that as long as you use the same app it will reuse the
	  saved config.
	- Fixed a bug in the fire plugin which was accidently broken by
	  Eric a few days ago. I also optimized Eric's solution a little by
	  avoiding the test for Colors==0 every time.
	- Added texture state caching for OpenGL::DrawPolygon. If the engine
	  sends in polygons with the same material together then OpenGL
	  will cache them and send them all to OpenGL at once. This is
	  especially the case when detail textures and fog. Depending on the
	  level this can be a big optimization. But the engine itself still
	  needs some enhancements to actually sort polygons on material and
	  so on.
	- Started work on HOWTO section in documentation.
	- Philip Wyett changed link for locaction to obtain WinCVS
	  client software. "http://www.wincvs.org" now seems to be
	  deprecated, so link now points to "http://www.cvsgui.org".
	- Martin Geisse did the following changes:
	    - The prefix config files can take an optional alias name that
	      is returned from GetFileName() instead of the real file name.
	      All other functions use the real file name.
	    - The config manager does not use the VFS pointer anymore to
	      identify single domains (only the file name).
	    - The user-specific, global domain is now called "User.Global",
	      the user-and-application-specific domain is now called
	      "User.Application".
	- Martin also optimized csHashCompute and changed hash iterators so
	  they now have a public constructor that initializes all elements,
	  removing the GetIterator() methods from csHashMap and csHashSet.
	  This allows creating these iterators on the stack in time-critical
	  situations.
9-May-2001
	- Martin Geisse added a version of typed vectors that don't delete
	  their elements.
	- Martin cleaned up the hashmap code using typed vectors.
	- Philip Wyett hacked round commits of yesterday because of the
	  following:
	    - Commented out case constant "cslfsTexturedNoFrame"
  	      which does not exist.
	    - Added member variable "bool DrawTextOnHighlightOnly",
  	      which was being initialized at construction, but
  	      which also did not exist.
	    - After diffing and finding out this was wrapping
  	      existing code. Commented out code which made calls
  	      to "GetDrawTextOnHighlightOnly()", which also does
  	      not exist.
	  libcsws now compiles again and all csws dependant
	  apps seem to be Ok.
	  In order to find the changes, just do a search for
	  "redeye", which marks all the changes.
	- More work on a better way to select mesh clippers for OpenGL.
	- Added Video.OpenGL.Caps.HWPlanes to opengl.cfg to select the
	  number of hardware OpenGL planes. Set to 0 if you don't have
	  any or don't want to use this.
	- Implemented hardware plane clipping in OpenGL.
	- Implemented additional lazy clipping phase.
	- Finished a totally new clipping selection system for OpenGL.
	  Read data/config/opengl.cfg for more info. The default is to
	  run a performance test (setting 'auto') which takes 14 seconds.
	  To avoid this delay you can copy the three lines that are
	  put on screen after this performance test to data/config/opengl.cfg.
	  The lines are the one with Video.OpenGL.Clip*.
	- Added missing support for fog in terrfunc terrain engine.
	- Christopher Nelson fixed his broken CVS commit from yesterday.
	  Here are his changes:
	    - csListBox is now skinnable, and has been for a while. I just
	      forgot to mention it. 
	    - csListBox has 3 new framestyles: Textured, Bitmap, and
	      BitmapNoFrame.  Just as with the other controls, you can set
	      a bitmap with transparency to be the background.  Listbox items
	      were also skinned, but nothing special was done with them.
	      I may in the future implement a function which lets you set a
	      bitmap for the highlight.  Currently the highlight is the same
	      as it always has been.
	    - csButton has a new member called SetDrawTextOnHighlightOnly().
	      I know it's long, but I wasn't sure how to reduce it's size and
	      still keep the meaning clear.  If you pass true to this member,
	      button text will only be drawn when the mouse is over this
	      button, or when the button is pressed.  This is very useful if
	      your buttons are all bitmaps, and you have the text displaying
	      beneath them.  If this doesn't make any sense, there is an
	      attatched .jpg file which shows a screen shot of what can be
	      done with the current version of csws using the bitmap frame
	      types.
8-May-2001
	- Martin Geisse did some changes in the RTTI macros:
	    - Extended object interfaces now use DECLARE_OBJECT_INTERFACE,
  	      just like normal object interfaces. The parent class is now
	      given in IMPLEMENT_OBJECT_INTERFACE_EXT.
	    - Added wrapper macros for csObject::GetChild().
	- Made some small enhancements to csIntersect3::IntersectSegment().
	- Added new version of csIntersect3::Plane().
	- Finally managed to implement a new software triangle clipper
	  for OpenGL. This triangle clipper will be used when all other
	  options are not possible. It is funny to see that this software
	  clipper is FASTER than letting OpenGL clip the triangles to the
	  screen boundaries on my card (ATI Rage PRO Mobility).
	- Moved the new ClipToPlane() routine which was specifically written
	  for the OpenGL clipper to csFrustum and generalized it.
	- Christopher Nelson did some minor bugfixes to the buttons to make
	  drawing work better with transparent/translucent overlays.
7-May-2001
	- Martin Geisse started to change the engine to use the new RTTI
	  system. Also changed IMPLEMENT_OBJECT_INTERFACE and
	  IMPLEMENT_OBJECT_INTERFACE_EXT. They now take the class they are
	  applied to and add it implicitly to the list of support cast types
	  (so you don't have to do that explicitly for every class).
	- Added 'strserv' to walkall target.
	- Fixed OpenGL multiply mode. It was using GL_DECAL when it should
	  use GL_MODULATE.
	- Added two new options to OpenGL config file (data/config/opengl.cfg):
	  Video.OpenGL.Caps.Stencil and Video.OpenGL.Caps.NeedScreenClipping.
	  Stencil is false by default but you can set it to true if you have
	  support for hardware stencil buffer. NeedScreenClipping if false
	  by default but you can set it to true if you experience bad
	  crashes with OpenGL.
	- Fixed a bug in the terrfunc interpolation routine for reading from
	  a heightmap. It was accessing past the heightmap boundaries.
	- Added iTerrFuncState::CorrectSeams() and GetCorrectSeams(). With
	  these you can enable correction for texture seams between adjacent
	  textures of the landscape for the given texture size. By default
	  no such correction happens.
	- Also added CORRECTSEAMS keyword to terrfunc loader.
	- Added MULTIPLY keyword to HEIGHTGEN in parser. This makes it easier
	  to quickly switch texture sizes for the generated terrain.
	- Added csIntersect3::IntersectSegment() to intersect a segment
	  with a frustum given by planes.
	- Continued working on a faster clipper for OpenGL meshes. It is
	  *almost* working but not yet :-)
	- Eric Sunshine worked around a NextStep compiler idiosyncrasy in
	  terrfunc.cpp and terrfunc.h where the compiler complained about
	  division by zero when expanding an inline function even though the
	  code correctly checked for this case.
6-May-2001
	- Martin Geisse made the following changes:
	    - csengine now depends on the string server. All apps have
	      been changed accordingly.
	    - Added RTTI interface to iObject and csObject.
	- Moved G3D->SetPerspectiveAspect() to init in csEngine::Draw()
	  instead of everywhere else.
	- Removed the obsolete inv_aspect field from the structures
	  sent to iGraphics3D.
	- Fixed the python plugin again.
	- Started work on improved DrawTriangleMesh for OpenGL. OpenGL
	  renderer will now keep a 3D frustum in camera space and recalc
	  this when needed (not finished yet).
	- Added static version of csFrustum::Intersect() and also added
	  a version to interesect a triangle.
	- Started working on better version of clipping DrawTriangleMesh
	  for OpenGL. Doesn't work yet.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated compilation warning about variable being
	  clobbered by longjmp() in jpgimage.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed several problems which were recently introduced
	  into various makefiles.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a portability problem in the Fire plugin where it
	  was relying on implicit initialization of several static global
	  tables.  Unfortunately, not all platforms correctly initialize such
	  data structures at plugin load time, so these tables must be
	  explicity initialized by the plugin itself.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated compilation warnings from stars.cpp and
	  ddgterr.cpp.
5-May-2001
	- Added HardTransform() to iMeshFactoryWrapper and
	  csMeshFactoryWrapper.
	- Received a new shuttle from Thomas Hieber. It is now used
	  as the main shuttle in the demo.
	- Made softer transitions in the demo between camera switches.
	- Martin Geisse added string server plugin and new pseudo-RTTI
	  system. Both still unused.
	- Philip Wyett eliminated some compiler warnings in MSVC
	  and MingW ports.
	- Philip also added Martins strserv plugin to global build process.
4-May-2001
	- Philip Wyett fixed the signed/unsigned warnings in the
	  sequence manager.
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed a typo in the simple tutorial in the docs.
	  A const char const* argv[] was missing the first const.
	  This caused Initialize not to override SysSystemdriver Initialize,
	  and this caused people to go crazy at the broken example. :-)
	- Wouter fixed some bugs in the terrain image generator.
	  Works now. But the debug printf needs to be enabled, otherwise
	  the blue channel seems to be lost (images turn yellow). Weird.
	- Added iTerrFuncState::SetHeightMap() to set a heightmap instead
	  of a function. Any iImage can be used. It will average the
	  red, green, and blue components. Size of the image is also not
	  important (except for terrain accuracy of course). Linear
	  interpolation is used to get inbetween values.
	- Added HEIGHTMAP keyword to the terrfunc loader.
	- Added new HEIGHTGEN keyword to the loader. With this keyword it
	  is now possible to use the new class from Wouter to dynamically
	  generate textures in combination with a heightmap.
	- Fixed a bug with 3D sprites which would crash on lighting if
	  the sprite contained vertices that were not used in triangles.
	  The function to calculate normals now sets the normal to 1,0,0
	  in such case (previously it was undefined which could cause
	  crashes).
	- If a sprite has only one frame then tweening will be disabled
	  by default. This should increase performance a little for them.
	- Fixed a bug in the new HEIGHTGEN keyword. Added SIZE and
	  PARTSIZE to make it easier.
	- Did a quick hack in the terrain engine so that it will correctly
	  align for textures of size 64! Need to make it more general so
	  that it works for all texture sizes though.
	- Robert Bate updated the Mac port again:
	    - Codewarrior is very picky with the floating point constants
	      passed to templated routines. Making sure they all are floats.
	    - Updating the JPEG, PNG anf ZLIB libaries to the latest and
	      greatest.
	    - New project files for CW Pro 6. These projects are Carbonized
	      (Run on both 9 and X).
3-May-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards did the following:
	  added a class that can generate iImages for terrain textures on
	  the fly. It is untested for the moment. You give some layers to it.
	  Each layer has a height where it is predominantly visible. Each
	  layers texture will show when the heightmaps is near that height.
	  In between the textures are blended.  You can also give layer
	  offset and scale. The textures are scaled up using trilinear
	  interpolation.
	  You can use this by creating the class. Then set the height
	  function to use. Then add some layers. Then generate parts of the
	  terrain texture, as iImages.
	- Philip Wyett removed the Direct3D and related Direct Draw plugins
	  from the win32 build process. This affects both mingw and
	  MSVC ports.
	- Philip Wyett changed Win32 OpenGL2D canvas from using a
	  standard popup window. to using a complete and correct caption
	  window with full system menu support.
	- Martin Geisse removed a few warnings in stars and OpenGL.
	- Changed the do_clip parameter in G3DTriangleMesh to clip_portal
	  and clip_plane.
	  There are two kinds of clipping: portal clipping (clipping to the
	  boundaries of the last portal we went through) and portalplane
	  clipping (clipping to the plane of the portal itself). Both are
	  handled seperatelly.
	  There are three cases for both portal clipping as portalplane
	  clipping (these are set in the fields clip_portal and clip_plane):
	  	- No clipping required (CS_CLIP_NOT): in this case the
		  engine is sure that the mesh will not need any clipping.
		- Clipping needed (CS_CLIP_NEEDED): in this case the
		  engine thinks that clipping may be needed. Depending on
		  the type of clipper (see later) this clipping is optional
		  or not.
		- Clipping for toplevel (CS_CLIP_TOPLEVEL): in this case the
		  engine knows that no clipping is needed to the current
		  clipper but clipping may be needed for the toplevel
		  clipper (or Z=SMALL_Z plane if used for plane clipping).
	  The engine will give a clipper to G3D. There are three cases:
	  	- Optional clipper (CS_CLIPPER_OPTIONAL): the clipper is
		  optional. This means that the z-buffer contents can
		  be trusted to clip the object. But a renderer for which
		  overdraw is slow can choose to do a lazy clip or exact
		  clip if it wants.
		- Toplevel clipper (CS_CLIPPER_TOPLEVEL): the clipper is
		  the toplevel clipper (i.e. the outermost portal, usually
		  close to the size of the window or screen). In this
		  case clipping is required but the renderer may have
		  some special ways to do this (like initializing the
		  Z-buffer around the borders of the portal).
		- Required clipper (CS_CLIPPER_REQUIRED): in this case the
		  clipper MUST be used (if CS_CLIP_NEEDED is set in the
		  mesh) and clipping must be exact (i.e. triangles may
		  not overlap the clip area).
	- Did the following changes to iGraphics3D:
	    - Changed SetClipper() and GetClipper() to work with iClipper2D.
	      This avoids a copy of the clipper.
	    - Added 'cliptype' parameter to SetClipper() which will be
	      one of the flags CS_CLIPPER_?
	    - Added GetClipType() function.
	    - Added SetNearPlane(), GetNearPlane(), ResetNearPlane(), and
	      HasNearPlane() to set the near clipping plane.
	- Fixed all 3D renderers except glide and Direct3D. These are now
	  totally outdated. Note that the handling in the renderers is not
	  yet smart. This is the framework. Now I need to do some work
	  to use the framework for very efficient mesh handling.
	- Changed the engine to call SetClipper() and SetNearPlane() every
	  time we go through a portal and at init time. This is much faster
	  than letting every single mesh object do this.
	- Changed csRenderView and iRenderView::ClipBBox() to return the
	  right clip_portal and clip_plane flags depending on the given
	  bounding boxes (screen and camera space).
	- Extended csCurve::GetScreenBoundingBox() so that it also returns
	  the camera bounding box.
	- Fixed all mesh and terrain plugins to use the new system when
	  talking to DrawTriangleMesh.
	- Changed terrfunc terrain plugin to be more clever about clipping
	  now. This also means that the bug with disappearing polygons
	  in front of the camera is now completely gone (touch wood!).
	- Philip Wyett fixed compile errors with null 3D renderer.
2-May-2001
	- Fixed the color bug in OpenGL DrawTriangleMesh with multi-
	  texturing.
	- Fixed several cases in the parsers where a boolean was read
	  but put in 'int'. This doesn't work since a recent change where
	  ScanStr works correctly on the 'bool' type. If %b is used for
	  ScanStr then the parameter should be 'bool' and not 'int'.
	  This mostly affected the LIGHTING() flag in several of the mesh
	  object loaders.
	- Enabled stencil buffer for Windows OpenGL canvas.
	- Enabled stencil buffer for X OpenGL canvas.
	- Experimented a bit with the stencil buffer for clipping and
	  DrawTriangleMesh. Not enabled by default yet since I have to
	  experiment with it.
	- Removed the obsolete and unused support for multiple textures
	  in G3DTriangleMesh. This now solved with materials.
	- Fixed an allocate of 0 size in the engine.
1-May-2001
	- Fixed a bug in software renderer so that tiling really works.
	- Extended the iMaterial structure in preparation of multi-texturing
	  support.
	- Extended the loader of materials in preparation of multi-texturing
	  support. There is now a new LAYER keyword in the definition
	  of a MATERIAL. In LAYER you can specify the texture, scale, shift,
	  and mixmode to use for that texture layer.
	- Fixed iso plugin for latest material changes.
	- Fixed MazeD for latest material changes.
	- Wouter Wijngaards added CS_FX_TILING to the bumptest bump layer.
	  It works perfectly nice in software now!
	- Wouter Wijngaards added small fix to demo.
	  if(elapsed_time == 0) return;  from NextFrame().
	  This avoids (almost 99%) of the jerkyness I experienced in
	  opengl mode. The reason was that high framerates and bad timer
	  caused 0 elapsed time, and a redraw of exactly the same frame,
	  filling up queues inside my bad driver, and causing a tug when
	  real work needed to be done.
	- Extended texture layer support in the engine so that maximum
	  four additional layers are supported (this means one base
	  texture and four extra). Note that none of the 3D renderers
	  currently support this.
	- The material manager in the 3D renderers is now capable of
	  holding four texture layers too. They are still not used
	  however.
	- Fixed a small bug in the OpenGL renderer with regards to
	  transparency that I introduced yesterday.
	- FINALLY fixed the very bad bug which completely locked up
	  my machine when a sprite was visible in fog using OpenGL
	  on an NVidia GeForce. It appears that the NVidia doesn't like
	  the use of glTexCoordPointer with 1 as the first parameter
	  (i.e. only one texture component). So fog and DrawTriangleMesh
	  finally works right with OpenGL!
	- Also fixed fog for DrawPolygonFX itself. DPFX was using perspective
	  correct texture mapping but fog was not doing that.
	- Added support for multi-texturing in OpenGL renderer for DrawPolygon,
	  DrawPolygonFX, and DrawTriangleMesh. data/flarge shows two
	  examples (one on the initial room and one on the sprites in the
	  large hall). Software renderer currently ignores the extra
	  textures. There is still a bug in the DrawTriangleMesh version
	  though. The color of gouraud shading seems to shift.
	- Martin Geisse fixed a lot of cases where the system driver was
	  IncRef'ed and DecRef'ed, which should not happen
30-Apr-2001
	- Philip Wyett fixed csVector3 up (); so that you/camera
	  is the right way up in ptlab. :-)
	- Brandon Ehle reports:
	  PS2 Port working, will post external libs soon, hopefully source
	  code for them will follow, if I find that Sony's OpenGL library
	  is horrid.
	  There are also changes to software renderer and iG3D interface
	  regarding uint32 ULong issues.  You should not assume that
	  ULong is a 32 bit datatype, but rather a datatype thats big and
	  goes really fast on the target platform.
	- Added support for FX mode scanline drawing to DrawPolygon.
	  So you can now use CS_FX_ADD (for example) with both lighted
	  and unlighted polygon drawing. Only CS_FX_TRANSPARENT is not
	  supported. Added 'mixmode' to G3DPolygonDP.
	- Moved MixMode from csPolyTexNone to csPolyTexType.
	- Removed csPolyTexNone and iPolyTexNone. This functionality is now
	  in csPolyTexType and iPolyTexType.
	- The changes above mean that MIXMODE() keyword for thing loader
	  will now work for all polygons.
	- Added FPS counter to csdemo. Currently displays on stdout.
	- Modified csdemo to make the stars using a single tiled polygon
	  with CS_FX_ADD mode (using the above new routines) instead of
	  a surface mesh object. This increases speed in the software renderer
	  from 10FPS to 14FPS!
	- Also added support for new FX polygon drawing in OpenGL/DrawPolygon.
	- Consistently renamed all GetMixmode() and SetMixmode() functions
	  to GetMixMode() and SetMixMode().
	- Added support for tiling in DrawPolygonFX and DrawTriangleMesh
	  (software renderer). This is enabled by the CS_FX_TILING flag
	  for mixmode. This is somewhat slower though so only use this if
	  you really need it. Tiling is not supported for images
	  with an alpha map. This tiling is untested for now.
29-Apr-2001
	- Fixed the python plugin again.
	- Fixed a bug that caused stray particle systems to be visible
	  in csdemo. This bug was actually rather bad and would case
	  children of mesh objects to be drawn several times unneeded.
	- Martin Geisse did further work on csparser and csengine.
	- Philip Wyett made csbumptest use a config file.
	- Wouter Wijngaards did two small fixes to bumptest:
	    - Improved efficiency of the procedural bumpmap, added a
	      RecalcFast method. The new method is >10x faster. Although
	      theoretically the quality should be lower, I cannot see
	      any difference.
	    - Procedural bump texture is now independent of u,v direction
	      size.
	    - Bumptest only does engine::Prepare once now.
	- Wouter also ran into a const problem with a SetTextureSpace method
	  when trying to fix Tunnel Fighter.
	- Philip Wyett fixed a few VC compiler warnings in csdemo and
	  phyztest.
28-Apr-2001
	- Removed a type->DecRef() in engine.cpp. The mesh object type
	  plugins can remain in memory. This DecRef() caused crashes
	  for csdemo.
	- Small fix in the sequence manager.
	- Fixed demo so that timewarping backwards with the big jump
	  ('<' key) will now restart the entire sequence manager which
	  means that child sequences will be correctly respawned. This
	  does not happen with the ',' key though.
	- Several small enhancements to csdemo:
	    - Fix with time warping again. Paths were not correctly cleaned
	      up.
	    - Slowed down entire demo 50% because speed was a bit too fast
	      to see everything good. However, this does mean that some
	      parts of the demo are a bit too slow now. So I will have
	      to do some path modifying again or else add extra stuff
	      to look at at those slow moments.
	    - Added '/' key to restart sequence manager and go back to the
	      same point in time. This is useful to get all paths running
	      ok again.
	    - The forward/up vector editor now correctly sets all objects
	      to the time of the point you are editing.
	    - Added new shuttle model from Michael Voase.
	    - Added new station model from Thomas Hieber (as yet untextured).
	    - Wouter Wijngaards did the following:
	      Added a bumpmapping test application. It contains a procedural
	      texture that is used to approximate bumpmapping. 3d hardware
	      may be able to do bumpmapping nicer looking and faster, if it
	      supports bumpmapping.  If it does not support bumpmapping,
	      the procedural texture is a good fallback option, that will
	      run on almost any hardware (and software too if we fix that).
	      Note that the software renderer does not really like the
	      tiling and DPFX calls, so the texture is stretched a bit -
	      there is one triangle where you can see what it should look
	      like. Under opengl the results look nice.
	      Note that this is a test for now. The code has not been
	      optimized at all.
	      And the computed overlays could be cached too. So don't look at
	      framerates.
	      When you start the application, you can see some wood texture
	      on the left (unbumpmapped). You can see a stone texture on the
	      right (the bumpmap texture). And the wood bumpmapped with
	      stone is in the middle. In the lower right hand corner you
	      can see a debug view of the bumpmapping.
	- Norman Kramer fixed the bug that made indexed bmp images fully
	  transparent.
27-Apr-2001
	- Martin did some further work on csparser and csengine.
	- Philip Wyett added csdemo.cfg to makefile inorder that it is
	  generated into MSVC project workspace.
	- Did some work on 3ds2lev:
	    - Added -3 option to allow convertion to 3D sprites. Seems to
	      be more or less working but it is not yet complete. I want
	      to add support for multiple objects.
	    - Added -vv option to do a very verbose output. With this option
	      it will show all chunks in the 3DS files that it encounters.
	    - Made level output a little more compatible with current CS
	      world file syntax.
	    - Removed unused -m option.
	    - Removed unused -f option.
	    - Renamed -l to -pl.
	    - Added new -l to list all objects in 3ds file.
	    - Added new -m option to convert one specific object
	      from the 3ds file. Specify the object with a number that you
	      get from -l. This technique is useful for converting one
	      3ds file to several 3D sprites.
	    - The -v option will now also show the local transformation matrix
	      and translation vector of all objects in the 3ds file. That
	      is useful for making hierarchical objects in CS.
	    - Added -r option to relocate the 3ds objects inside. -r is
	      executed AFTER -s.
	    - Renamed -y option to -f (force).
	    - Added -xyz, -xzy, -yxz, -yzx, -zxy, and -zyx commandline options
	      to change the order of the x,y,z components from 3DS to CS.
	      Default is -xyz.
	- Probably fixed a bug in the csdemo sequence manager with regards
	  to time-warping. Not sure though. This is complicated stuff and
	  I'll have to look a little closer at it.
	- Added iSequence::GetMainTime() to get the current time from
	  the sequence manager.
	- Using the above new function I greatly simplified processing
	  of time in the demo sequence manager. All operations that are
	  supposed to be handled by the sequence manager now operate
	  on sequence manager time and no longer use the real time.
	  This possibly fixes a time misalignment bug that sometimes
	  seemed to occur when doing big time warps.
	- Norman Kramer added saving to bmp plugin.
	- Norman also added the ability to save tga files.
26-Apr-2001
	- Philip Wyett fixed gcc outputting Worm.dll and Dog.dll. Now
	  outputs worm.dll and dog.dll.
	- Philip changed the makefile system so that INTEL is replaced
	  with X86. This will please people that have an AMD processor :-)
	- Extended the fire particle system loader with a new ORIGINBOX
	  keyword which allows the origin to be specified as a box. The
	  fire particle system could already do that but the loader didn't
	  support it. Fixed saver to save to ORIGINBOX instead of ORIGIN.
	- Additionally added support for DIRECTION keyword in fire loader
	  and saver.
	- Updated documentation to reflect above changes and also added
	  BASECOLOR keyword to the spr3d doc.
	- Added iEngine::DeleteMeshFactory(), LoadMeshFactory(), and
	  LoadMeshObject() conveniance functions. The last two are especially
	  nice as they give an easy way to load a mesh object or factory from
	  a loader plugin.
	- Added iMeshWrapper::AddChild() to add a child mesh to some parent
	  mesh. This routine correctly unlinks the mesh from its previous
	  parent (can be the engine or another mesh).
	- Fixed sector handling in mesh wrapper so that children will now
	  automatically be moved to the correct sector when the parent is.
	- Added iEngine::NextFrame() (to complement csEngine::NextFrame()).
	- Added subtract operations to csColor.
	- Did many optimizations to the fire particle system by
	  precalculating a lot.
	- Did an optimization in the engine. When a mesh is marked as
	  invisible (CS_ENTITY_INVISIBLE) csEngine::NextFrame() will not
	  process it.
	- Did an additional optimization so that mesh objects will only call
	  NextFrame() as soon as they are really drawn on screen. i.e. as
	  soon as DrawTest() returns true. This should increase global
	  speed of the engine if there are many particle systems and sprites
	  in the world but they are all currently invisible.
	- Worked more on csdemo.
	- Martin Geisse did a small bug fix in engine.cpp.
	- Simplified the sequencer in csdemo. There is now no special handling
	  of the camera path as opposed to mesh object paths. There are
	  simply paths that are attached to either a mesh or a camera.
	  Remove PATHMESH and PATHCAMERA commands and replaced with PATH.
	  Also added the possibility to replace the object on a path with
	  another. That way you can let the camera view be replaced by
	  some object and set the camera else-where for example. This
	  can be set with the ATTACH command.
	- Martin Geisse changed csdemo to use a config file.
	- Martin did some further work on csparser and csengine.
	- Norman Kramer removed the DO_<image format> variables. select
	  the image plugins by commenting in/out the appropriate PLUGIN
	  lines.
	- Norman Kramer added the ability to save jpg files to the jpg
	  plugin.
25-Apr-2001
	- Philip Wyett cleaned up formatting in ptlab.cfg.
	- Martin Geisse added an SCF interface for collection (iCollection).
	- Martin renamed csEngine::CreateCamera to CreateCameraPosition
	  which better describes its purpose. It also returns the
	  iCameraPosition now. CreateCollection now looks if a collection
	  with the given name exists before creating one.
	- Extended 3D sprite mesh plugin with SetBaseColor() and
	  GetBaseColor(). This color is added to the color of all vertices.
	  This works both with or without lighting. Also added BASECOLOR()
	  keyword for the loader of 3D sprites.
	- Further improved csdemo with new path editing capabilities.
	  Added laser beams for the fighers. Added photon torpedo.
	  Increased the resolution of the star-field...
	- Fixed all image loader plugins to make a global var static.
	  If this doesn't happen then it isn't possible to statically link
	  the image loaders.
        - Eric Sunshine modified user.mak so that the gif, png, jpg, and mplex
          image loaders are listed under PLUGINS rather than PLUGINS.DYNAMIC.
          These image types are used very commonly, so they will almost
          certainly be required by any application which is linked statically.
          Therefore, they should appear in PLUGINS.  The other less commonly
          used image loaders, bmp, tga, sgi, and wal are still listed under
          PLUGINS.DYNAMIC.
	- Eric Sunshine added a $(Z_LIBS) reference to LIB.PNGIMG.SPECIAL in
	  pngio.mak.  It is necessary to link this plugin with zlib since
	  libpng requires it.
24-Apr-2001
	- Martin Geisse possibly fixed the lockup that Philip get when
	  exiting Blocks. The bug was in the WaveOut sound driver.
	- Tried to fix OpenGL colors on my system but it fails for text.
	  Don't know what is wrong. I did fix a few things though. Colors
	  should now be right for lines and other 2D features.
	- Did a lot of enhancements on csdemo with regards to online editing
	  of all the paths. Also improved the looks of the flare.
	- Wouter Wijngaards did the following:
	  you can now override the default for the 3d card capabilities.
	  In data/config/opengl.cfg.
	- Martin Geisse fixed a warning for Win32/csosdefs.h.
	- Further extended csdemo with a more descriptive display of the
	  current selected point in the selected path (in edit mode).
23-Apr-2001
	- Norman Kramer fixed phyztest. Now compiles again, the chain seems
	  to work, but the spring falls through the sector walls.
	- Norman changed CSFX to CSGFX in video.mak.
	- Norman swapped red and blue in avi plugin.
	- Philip Wyett did further work on the WinCVS tutorial.
	- Fixed 'walkall' target. Removed obsolete 'imgload' target and
	  added 'imgplex', 'gifimg', 'jpgimg', 'pngimg', and 'bmpimg'.
	- Added csCubicSpline::InsertPoint(), RemovePoint(), SetTimeValue(),
	  and SetDimensionValue().
	- Made a csSpline superclass. Let csCubicSpline inherit from this.
	  Added csBSpline and csCatmullRomSpline.
	- csPath now inherits from csCatmullRomSpline. This is much nicer.
	- Added csPath::SetXxxVector() and GetXxxVector().
	- Added iCamera::Perspective() and InvPerspective().
	- Added a new generic demo application. At this moment it is still
	  not totally generic. For that I need the loader as a plugin which
	  isn't possible yet. So at this moment you have to modify the app
	  to have other objects. The sequences are load dynamically however.
22-Apr-2001
	- Norman Kramer split the image loader into several plugins
	  (iImageIO). Also added support for image saving (currently only
	  implemented by the png plugin).
	- Norman Kramer fixed several apps so that they use the new png
	  saver plugin.
	- Added iBaseHalo, iCrossHalo, iNovaHalo, and iFlareHalo SCF interfaces
	  to access halo's.
	- Added CreateCrossHalo(), CreateNovaHalo(), and CreateFlareHalo()
	  to iLight.
	- Fixed a bug in software renderer GetZBuffValue(). When the z-buffer
	  was initializes to 0 it would return 0. But it does return 1/0 so
	  instead we now let it return a very big value. This fixes halos
	  for example for apps that initialize the Z-buffer (walktest doesn't).
	- Did a similar fix to the OpenGL version of GetZBuffValue().
	- Added 'stars' mesh object plugin. This can be used to simulate
	  movement in space. At this moment this plugin doesn't work yet.
	- Philip Wyett did a temporary hack to fix compile errors introduced
	  by Wouter's changes yesterday. 
	  x, y and z are not part of csBox3, thus "state->GetOrigin().x",
	  "state->GetOrigin().y", "state->GetOrigin().z" generates errors.
	  Changed to "state->GetOrigin().MinX" etc. as a temp fix which still
	  leaves the 'flame' working when introduced into 'walktest'.
	- Fixed a small compiler error in the fire loader.
21-Apr-2001
	- Changed csCubicSpline so that it is no longer required to first
	  set the time values and then the dimension values. Precalculation
	  of derivatives is delayed until later.
	- With the help of Wouter Wijngaards, fixed csCubicSpline so that
	  it doesn't oscilate into infinity. But it isn't as smooth anymore.
	- Wouter Wijngaards did the following for the iso engine:
	  Added optimization to the iso Engine:
	    - A complex system of material registration (by the engine object)
  	      which allows the polygons in the main pass to be rendered out
	      of order, sorted by material. This is supposed to be very good
	      for certain hardware. But not my hardware. Perhaps someone
	      with better hardware can test if framerates have improved.
	    - The iso engine can create iMaterialWrappers for you. Those
	      have the same interface as the regular 3d engine of CS.
	      Except that private object returns the iso object (which
	      is almost compatible). Also they implement
	      iIsoMaterialWrapperIndex, an interface that allows the iso
	      engine to get the index to sort by material. If no such
	      interface is detected, the polygon is drawn immediately.
	    - The isorenderview contains the buckets for sorting by
	      material. The buckets are kept preallocated (in an ever
	      growing queue).
	  For all this, the framerates in my software and opengl renderers
	  is exactly as it was before :-)
	- Wouter Wijngaards also says:
	  After getting a request to make a 3d fire particle system,
	  and due consideration of how other fire particle systems look,
	  I have come to the conclusion that the current fire particle
	  system is adequate for the task.
	  I have, however, ameliorated the current fire particle system
	  by allowing the starting origin to be given as a Box (possible
	  min=max, a point). Each particle is randomly started in the box.
	  The walktest demo 'flame' now starts the particles in a
	  square upon the ground. This is already pretty fiery. An
	  improvement would be having the artists for your game make a
	  nice particle texture.
20-Apr-2001
	- Philip Wyett added WinCVS tutorial to the CS docs.
	- Moved all flags from csMeshWrapper to iMeshWrapper.
	  Also added GetFlags() to iMeshWrapper.
	- Added SetMeshObjectFactory() to iMeshFactoryWrapper.
	- Added SetZBufMode() and GetZBufMode() to iMeshWrapper.
	- Made ball plugin more efficient for OpenGL by setting do_clip
	  right.
	- Added a new surface mesh plugin which will make a surface for
	  DrawTriangleMesh.
	- Added HardTransform(), GetWorldBoundingBox() and
	  GetTransformedBoundingBox() to iMeshWrapper.
19-Apr-2001
	- Martin Geisse did further work on csparser.
	- Martin also rewrote the DECLARE_TYPED_VECTOR macro to be really
	  type-safe.
	- Added a new sequence manager plugin. With this plugin you can manage
	  operations that have to be done at specific times. You define
	  sequences containing sequence operations. Sequences can be inserted
	  in the sequence manager which will perform the operations in that
	  sequence at the right time. Sequences can also contain operations
	  to spawn new sequences and sequences also have conditional
	  statements. The main purpose of this sequence manager is to allow
	  demos or intros which are controlled by this system.
	  The sequence manager is completely time correct (if it has no bugs
	  of course). The 'Do' function which you have to provide for
	  every sequence operation will get the difference between the time
	  now and the time that the operation had to be executed so you can
	  take corrective measures. The reason that operations are not always
	  executed at the right time is that frame rate can be low and
	  the sequence manager only gets executed once every frame.
	- Added cylindrical texture mapping option to the ball mesh plugin.
	  Normally the ball will only use a circle in the texture for both
	  the top and bottom halves. This is good for skydomes and so on but
	  not very useful for planets. So with cylindrical mapping the entire
	  texture is used. There is a new CYLINDRICAL keyword in the ball
	  loader as well.
	- Eric Sunshine reverted Philip Wyett's changes to blocks.cpp.  Philip
	  was trying to eliminate a hang at termination time on Win2000, but
	  only ended up side-stepping the issue by leaking the csSystemDriver.
	- Norman Kramer added a few missing DecRef()'s from WalkTest.
	- Wouter Wijngaards says:
	  Although Jorrit's fix for the out of bounds error in procedural
	  plasma, (an exact value of 256 could be generated) was correct,
	  I moved the fix to another, precalculated phase. This moves the
	  bounds test from the inner loop to the table precalculation.
	- Moved all flags from csEngine to iEngine.
	- Wouter Wijngaards added the distinction between static and
	  dynamic lighting to isometric engine. Lights are by default
	  static. Static lights are only recalculated when a static light
	  is changed in a grid. Dynamic lighting is calculated per frame.
	  The isotest now uses a dynamic light for the player, the
	  blue light is a static light.
	- Philip Wyett did some code cleanup in win32/csosdefs.h.
18-Apr-2001
	- Removed the test for stencil buffer since it seems that just doing
	  that test is enough to break significant parts of OpenGL on some
	  3D cards.
	- Fixed a bug with the software renderer which was introduced
	  by me yesterday. The bug caused DrawPolygonFX to give incorrec
	  results in some cases.
	- Fixed a small bug in the copy constructor of csFrustumContext.
	  The field first_time was not copied.
	- Added csColor::ClampDown() which will make sure color components
	  are not negative.
	- Fixed the terrain engine so that it will no longer generate negative
	  colors. This resulted in colorful displays on some 3D hardware using
	  OpenGL.
	- Eric Sunshine repaired the funky csPortalSectorCallback declaration
	  so that it is now sane.  (This fix also helps to appease VC++.)
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a printf() format conversion warning from
	  lghtmap.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed csLoaderStats so that it compiles on OpenStep.
	  The OpenStep compiler is buggy and requires that an inline function
	  calling a second inline functions only do so after the second inline
	  function has already been seen by the compiler.
	- Fixed a bug in csCubicSpline. It was ignoring the dimension in
	  GetInterpolatedDimension().
	- Fixed csReversibleTransform::LookAt(). The was interpreting the
	  up vector in a negative way. I fixed Blocks too.
	- Fixed several bugs reported by a memory checker:
	    - In archive.cpp: free (buffer) with buffer == NULL.
	    - Fixed a bug in plasma procedural texture. It was sometimes
	      trying to access palette index 256 which is one out of bounds.
	      I fixed this by adding an overflow test for this which is
	      probably not the best way.
	    - Found a bad memory access in the software texture
	      cache. This is a bit more complicated so I did
	      not fix it yet but put a '@@@' comment there.
	      This bug could very well be the cause for the
	      bad texture cache contents that happens with very
	      thin polygons.
	- Martin Geisse added QueryObject() method to engine objects
	  (subclasses of csObject). This returns the iObject interface
	  for these objects, just like QUERY_INTERFACE, but is faster.
	- Christopher Nelson updated header files for skinned listbox
	  and scrollbar and also added sdscrbar.cpp default scrollbar skin.
	- Christopher also did the following:
	    - Updated csListBox to be a skinned object, now supports
	      cslfsTextured and cslfsBitmap.
	    - Updated csScrollBar to be a skinned object.
	    - Fixed dumb bug with csListbox and csScrollBar not being drawn.
	    - Fixed bug where bitmapped or textured dialogs don't
	      redraw children right.
17-Apr-2001
	- Martin Geisse eliminated some warnings in the function terrain
	  loader.
	- Philip Wyett eliminated three uninitialized variable warnings to ch
	  under VC6 (avi plugin).
	- Implemented TEST and NONE z-buffer modes for all perspective correct
	  texture mapping routines in the software renderer.  Also implemented
	  TEST z-buffer mode routines for all perspetive incorrect texture
	  mapping routines.  This completes support for all Z-buf modes in the
	  software renderer.
	- Fixed a bug in the OpenGL renderer with regards to clearing of the
	  Z-buffer.  When the last operation in the previous frame disables the
	  Z-buffer writing (glDepthMask()) then the clear of the Z-buffer will
	  not happen.  This is because glClear() actually listens to the buffer
	  write masks and doesn't update the buffer when the mask is disabled.
	  This affected iso mostly as CS normally doesn't require a clear of
	  the Z-buffer.
	- Started preparation work for stencil buffer support in OpenGL
	  renderer.
	- Added csCubicSpline to csgeom.  This is going to be used for an algo
	  to calculate a smooth path between points.
	- Wouter Wijngaards did the following update: The isometric sprites now
	  use zbuffer TEST mode when the sprite is transparent.  This removes
	  some glitches in drawing overlapping transparent sprites.
	- Eric Sunshine reverted Philip Wyett's changes to blocks.cpp.
	  Philip's intention was to fix a problem with Blocks locking up at
	  termination time on Windows 2000.  Unfortunately, his changes were
	  entirely invalid for the following reasons:
	    - He moved the `delete' call for the system driver into its own
	      destructor.  Thus, the object's own destructor was trying to
	      destroy itself.
	    - He removed all code which performed termination-time clean-up and
	      shut-down.  Rather than actually solving the lock-up problem on
	      Windows 2000, he simply side-stepped the issue entirely by not
	      performing any application clean-up.  This is _not_ an acceptable
	      solution.
	- Eric Sunshine reverted Philip Wyett's change to walkdbg.cpp.  The
	  problem with this change was that Philip was addressing the symptom
	  of the problem rather than the problem itself.  Additionally, his
	  change added unnecessary pollution to the global name space.
	  Instead, I (Eric) solved the problem in a more correct fashion.
	- Eric Sunshine repaired the following makefile-related problems which
	  were recently introduced into the project:
	    - Removed the video/loader reference from mk/msvcgen/required.mak.
	      This was not the appropriate place to list this module.
	    - Removed the video/loader reference from mk/subs.mak.  This was
	      not the appropriate place to list this module.
	    - Added a video/loader reference to mk/user.mak.  This _is_ the
	      appropriate place to list such modules.
	    - Removed the obsolete csstdldr reference from mk/user.mak.
	- Eric Sunshine repaired imgload.mak so that it works correctly on
	  platforms which define a custom DO.PLUGIN makefile variable.  (In his
	  CVS log message for the previous version of this makefile, Norman
	  correctly speculated that I would end up changing things around.)
	  Fixing the problem required the introduction of distinct plugin build
	  steps in a fashion analogous to the DO.DEP1/DO.DEP2 solution of yore.
	  Also repaired glrender.mak, cspython.mak, csjava.mak, and cslua.mak;
	  all of which experienced the same problem.
	- Eric Sunshine added assignment operators for object duplication to
	  csFrustumContext and csLightingInfo in order to appease the NextStep
	  compiler which had difficulty synthesizing default assignment
	  operators for these objects.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated several compilation warnings in
	  csSector::IntersectSphere().
	- Eric Sunshine commented out several bits of code in `levtool' which
	  broke following major changes by Jorrit to the engine.  This quick
	  patch allows the application to compile cleanly without crashing the
	  build process, despite the fact that the application is in need of a
	  major overhaul.  Also added CSGFX to the dependency list in
	  levtool.mak.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed SetGridChangeCallback() and
	  GetGridChangeCallback() in iso.h and isospr.h so that they compile
	  error-free with the broken NextStep compiler.  Function pointer
	  references were confusing the electronic fellow.  In the process,
	  increased the likelihood that humans will be able to parse these
	  function protyptes as well.
	- Eric Sunshine added missing CSGFX dependency to blocks.mak.
	- Eric Sunshine added missing CSGFX dependency to cctest.mak.
	- Eric Sunshine added missing CSGFX dependency to csfedit.mak.
	- Eric Sunshine added missing CSGFX dependency to cswstest.mak.
	- Eric Sunshine added missing CSGFX dependency to map2cs.mak.  Also
	  worked around circular reference problem at link time between cssys
	  and csutil.
	- Eric Sunshine added missing CSGFX dependency to meta.mak.
	- Eric Sunshine added missing CSGFX dependency to squawk.mak.
	- Christopher Nelson added modified csdialog header for overlay
	  support. Also support for skinned listbox headers.
	- Christopher also did some further updates to cslistbox to make
	  it work better as a skinned control.
	- Christopher also implemented alpha with listbox.
	- Christopher squashed some bugs with display mess-ups using
	  bitmap frames and buttons in CSWS.
	- Implemented LookAt(), RotateOther(), and RotateThis() in
	  csReversibleTransform. These functions used to be in csCamera
	  but now csCamera simply inherits them.
	- Also removed LookAt() from iCamera. This is now in the
	  return transform.
	- Removed RotateWorld() and Rotate() from csCamera and iCamera.
	  Use RotateOther() and RotateThis() in csReversibleTransform.
	- Added csPath to csgeom library. This is a subclass of
	  csCubicSpline that will interpolate over 9 dimensions (position,
	  up-vector, and forward-vector). This is ideal in combination with
	  csReversibleTransform::LookAt() to have an object or camera move
	  along a path. This code (as well as the cubic spline code) is
	  totally untested at this moment.
	- Fixed the python plugin and pysimp applications so that they
	  work again.
	- Philip Wyett fixed Blocks on Windows 2000 again after Eric
	  reverted his previous (bad) fix.
	- Norman Kramer added a new export script for Blender 2.12 (scripts/
	  blender/csexp212.py). This script can export all meshes in a scene
	  to mesh factories. All the factories are placed in a LIBRARY called
	  scene.lib.
16-Apr-2001
	- Added iEngine::CreateSectorWallsMesh().
	- Fixed simplep (plugin version of simple) so that it works again.
	- Philip Wyett fixed a little nasty bug under Windows 2000 for Blocks.
	  Removed void cleanup() and all it's calls and moved all it's contents
	  to the blocks destructor.  This fixes where Windows 2000 could not
	  successfully close the app and locked up (non responding).
	- Philip also removed lots of compiler warnings in VC6 port.  85% of CS
	  warnings many VC specific and some which should have been apparrent
	  in other compilers.
	- Wouter Wijngaards did some more work on the isometric engine:
	    - Changed size of front facing sprites to be more correct.  (less
	      fat).
	    - Added a 'halo' sprite for the blue light in isotest - you can see
	      the alpha problems using both transparent sprites now.  However,
	      when I try to enable ZBUF_TEST, the effect is ZBUF_NONE.
	- Wouter also changed the demo particle systems in walktest to use
	  ZBUF_TEST mode.  This makes them look a lot better.  For the 'flame'
	  commans (a fire particle system), this helps a lot.
	- Martin Geisse extended the iEngine interface and added iTextureList.
	- Martin also added lots of methods to iTextureWrapper.
15-Apr-2001
	- Martin Geisse removed csstdldr, the test application for it, the
	  iLoader interface and renamed iLoaderNew to iLoader.
	- Martin also made the csparser stats counter a non-static member of
	  csloader
	- Martin added a parameter to the Delete(), Replace() and DeleteAll()
	  functions of csVector that lets you choose whether to free the
	  deleted element.
	- Philip Wyett did the following:
	  Brought VC6 port into the new millennium by updating png lib used
	  from 1.0.0.2 to 1.0.1.0.  This update offers many little texture
	  artifact fixes/improvements which I will not bother to list, check
	  the apps for yourselves.  ;-)
	  Updated MSVC project file auto-generation process to elimate
	  '/NODEFAULTLIB: "LIBC"' warnings generated by the change.  Updated
	  docs to point to location of new winlibs package (version 16) where
	  it will be stored on the 3D Downloads site.
	  NOTE:
	  The new lib requires use of a new "png.dll", which can be
	  obtained temporarily from the Red Eye Entertainment server.
	  "winlibs16.zip" can be obtained via the following link:
	  http://www.redeye-entertainment.co.uk/downloads/cs/winlibs16.zip
	- Significantly updated the new function terrain engine. The main
	  structure has basically been totally restructured. There is a
	  new LOD algorithm that works with edge collapsing. This works
	  a lot better than the old algorithm but I'm still not completely
	  statisfied. Either there is a bug in the algo somewhere (likely)
	  or else the algo itself is flawed because at high lod levels
	  the triangle distortions are rather large.
	  There is also a big speed improvement for the terrain engine
	  on 3D cards that support hardware accelerated transform and
	  lighting. When a terrain block is fully visible the no_clip
	  variable will be set to false meaning that the renderer can
	  use the fast version of DrawTriangleMesh. This makes the
	  terrain almost four to five times faster on a GeForce. This
	  is still not the best solution. The best solution is that the
	  hardware itself performs the clipping somehow (stencil?).
	- Philip Wyett did a minor update to win32.txi.
	- Richard D. Shank did a minor update to win32.txi.
14-Apr-2001
	- Philip Wyett added 'include imap/parser.h" and fixed many of a slew
	  of compiler errors in the app.  App is still broken though at
	  present.
	- Martin Geisse fixed a few more applications with regards to the
	  csparser stuff.
	- Martin also did further work on csloader:
	    - Added a new image format flag that indicates an invalid format.
	      This flag may not be used in csImage or the image loader, but
	      higher-level modules such as csloader may use this flag to say
	      'use the default format'.  It's much like the NULL pointer.
	    - Extended csLoader::LoadImage() so you can choose an alternate
	      format for the image.
	    - Extended csLoader::LoadTexture() so you can choose an alternate
	      texture manager for the texture.
	    - Ptlab uses the extended LoadImage() instead of its own function.
	    - Cleaned up the way csloader handles plugins.
13-Apr-2001
	- Martin Geisse did the following changes:
	    - Added texture loading methods to iLoaderNew.  The loader now uses
	      these functions for texture loading.
	    - Added a temporary function to iTextureWrapper to get the private
	      csTextureWrapper object.
	    - Fixed a bug in csTextureWrapper.
	    - Fixed VC compilation problems in csPortal.
	    - Made all static functions non-static.
	    - Removed all unneeded static variables and cleaned up some
	      temporary stuff.
	    - Added interface methods for all public loading functions.
	    - Parser plugins are now unloaded at destruction.
	    - Moved loading mode definitions to imap/parser.h.
	    - Removed a lot of unneeded csloader.h includes.
	    - Changed csparser to use iLoaderNew for sound loading.
	- Wouter Wijngaards updated the iso engine. The engine now has
	  colored, dynamic lighting. Shadows are calculated in realtime.
	  In addition he did the following things:
	    - Smaller player.
	    - Added a stone pillar to the isotest app to show the lighting and
	      shadows.
	    - Added a nice doorway to show off lighting.
	    - The blue light now uses another attenuation type, nicely casts
	      through the door opening now.
	    - The vertical scale has been corrected for the skew.
	    - Performed some speed optimisations.
	    - Added mouse support to isotest.  You can click where you want to
	      move to.
	    - Made keyboard cursorskeys in isotest more intuitive.
	    - Added support for transparency in the isometric engine.
  	    - Changed the player sprite in isotest to be partially transparent.
	- Michael Voase declared spr_write() in impexp.h. csparser now
	  compiles.
	- Fixed Philip's fix on the terrain engine. Now it works AND
	  compiles on VC.
	- Philip Wyett fixed texture loading errors in ptlab and video.
	- Luca Pancallo extended ASE importer in impexp. Luca also added
	  a CS sprite exporter.
	- Fixed a VERY old bug in all 3D renderers with DrawTriangleMesh.
	  The bug was that triangles that are very close to the camera (i.e.
	  one or more vertices are behind the view plane) were simply rejected.
	  But this means that triangles could get clipped away completely
	  even when visible. This badly affected the terrain engines (both
	  DDG as terrfunc). At this moment the problem seems 95% solved. There
	  are still situations where polygons disappear when close to the
	  camera but it is rare now. I will look at this later.
	- Worked on a better LOD system for new terrain engine. This LOD
	  system is based on the principle of edge collapsing (but with
	  a better cost function than the one that is used for sprites).
	  It isn't finished yet so there is nothing to see at the moment.
12-Apr-2001
	- Philip Wyett fixed a couple of function declaration redefinition
	  compile errors under VC6.
	- Philip fixed a problem in VC with the terrain engine.
	- Added support for 'KEY' nodes in terrain objects.
	- Extended iTerrainObject with GetDirLightPosition(),
	  GetDirLightColor(), and IsDirLightEnabled().
	- Added new cmd_AnimateDirLight key command to WalkTest. This will
	  animate a directional light for a terrain object.
	- Added SetReversed(), IsReversed(), SetTopOnly(), and IsTopOnly()
	  to the ball mesh plugin. With reversed mode you can let the
	  triangles be visible from the inside instead of outside. With
	  top-only only the top half of the sphere is generated. Using
	  these two flags you can make a skydome. Also extended the ball
	  loader with the keywords REVERSED and TOPONLY.
	- In addition also added SetLighting() and IsLighting() and the
	  LIGHTING keyword.
	- Finally added SetColor() and GetColor() and COLOR keyword to set
	  the base color for the ball.
	- Added a new terrain engine. This one is a lot simpler than the
	  DDG engine and is based on a function instead of a heightmap.
	  You can of course use a function that reads from a heightmap. In
	  the future there will be a conveniance function that does this.
	  You can also optionally give a function that will return normals
	  (for lighting). If you don't give such a function it will try
	  to calculate the normals itself. The terrain engine supports
	  LOD (four levels of LOD). You can divide the terrain in blocks.
	  Every block has its own texture and has four levels of LOD.
	  The terrain engine also supports dynamic directional lighting.
	  Note that this is unfinished work. There are still some bugs in
	  CS to solve (same bugs that make the DDG terrain engine not
	  look nice) and better visibility testing is also needed.
	  The default function for the terrain is a sin+cos function.
	  Also LOD is not really implemented at the moment.
	- Removed SKYDOME keyword from thing loader. Skydomes can now
	  be done using the ball mesh plugin.
	- Fixed an initialization bug in the new terrain engine. It should
	  now work.
	- Also started working a little on LOD support. Not finished yet.
	- Norman Kramer fixed a VERY weird bug in ScanStr. If you used
	  ScanStr with %b it would actually crash in very rare cases
	  (like with the ball loader plugin). Fixed it by replacing
	  the va_arg type for %b by 'bool'. It used to be 'int'. I have
	  no idea what is going on here and I also don't know why this
	  problem suddenly pops up now.
11-Apr-2001
	- Norman Kramer fixed ptlab.
	- Norman Kramer fixed the video app so that it works completely
	  through the new mesh object system.
	- Wouter Wijngaards added an isometric engine plugin. This is only
	  the first version and it still needs a lot of work. But it
	  compiles and runs. There is an isometric engine plugin and
	  an isotest application.
	- Added the notion of recursion level in csRenderContext. Also added
	  GetRenderRecursionLevel() and SetRenderRecursionLevel() to
	  iRenderView. Using this the engine will be able to test how deep
	  it is with going through portals.
	- Added the notion of render context data. This is data that can
	  be attached to a recursion level in the render context and can
	  also be retrieved while that recursion level is active. If a
	  recursion level is deleted (when coming back from a portal for
	  example) all the render context data will also be deleted.
	  Render context data has a key (void*) and a value (iBase*).
	- Using the above changed I fixed a potentially serious bug in the
	  visibility culling system. The visibility culling and drawing
	  are now seperate actions. However the thing which does the
	  visibility culling wants to remember all polygons that were found
	  visible in a queue so that when the same thing is rendered later
	  only those polygons are rendered. This worked fine before I
	  implemented render priorities because the thing containing the
	  culler (bsp/octree) was rendered first. However with render
	  priorities this is no longer guaranteed and there can be situations
	  in which there are other things that are rendered first before
	  the thing containing the culler. In really bad cases those other
	  things could in theory contain portals to sectors and those portals
	  could eventually cause the same thing with the culler to be
	  rendered. But this would cause an overwrite of the polygon
	  queue! This is now fixed by attaching the render queue as
	  render context data to the current recursion level. When a portal
	  is traversed it may potentially also want to use this queue but
	  it will use another one because it is in another recursion level
	  so other render context data is used.
	- Added csSector::RelinkMesh(). This is used to relink a mesh
	  when conditions in the mesh have changed (like render priority).
	  The sector needs to know this to put the mesh in the right render
	  priority queue.
	- Fixed csMeshWrapper::SetRenderPriority() so that it will notify
	  all the sectors where the mesh is by calling RelinkMesh().
	- Added SetLighting() and IsLighting() to iSprite3DState. Extended
	  sprite loader plugin with LIGHTING keyword. Extended sprite saver
	  plugin with support for saving LIGHTING value. Extended 3D sprite
	  plugin to disable lighting based on this flag (default is lighting
	  enabled).
	- Fixed 3D sprites so that they use GetFullTransform() for lighting
	  too. This means that lighting will now be correct if a sprite is
	  used from within a hierarchical transformation.
	- Fixed a bug with lighting for 3D sprites and other mesh objects.
	  When there were no lights reaching a sprite anymore (after having
	  been hit by one or more lights before) the lighting would not be
	  disabled.
	- Extended RENDERPRIORITIES system with a sorting parameter. This
	  sorting parameter is not yet used but the parser already parses
	  it. Possible values are BACK2FRONT, FRONT2BACK, or NONE.
	- Fixed a few small problems in the DDG landscape plugin (mostly
	  source code cosmetic ones).
10-Apr-2001
	- Implemented render priority queues in sectors. All meshes added to
	  a sector will automatically be placed in the right queue. At render
	  time they will be rendered in the right order.
	- Fixed a bug with visibility culling. Meshes that are already in
	  the sector at the time the culler is created were not registered
	  to the visibility culler.
	- Added csEngine::GetSkyRenderPriority(), GetWallRenderPriority(),
	  GetObjectRenderPriority() and GetAlphaRenderPriority().
	- When a new mesh object is created it will by default get object
	  render priority.
	- Fixed a crasher bug when cleaning up the mesh priority queues
	  in csSector.
9-Apr-2001
	- Michael Voase did a slight visual change to MazeD.
	- Michael also removed bogus comment about non existant bug
	  in the loader.
	- Norman Kramer fixed the case insensitivity problem in scf
	  classname construction (for avi) (hopefully there aren't codecs
	  that distinguish by case only).
	- Norman also fixed a color problem in the avi plugin.
	- Removed the 'movable' from csThing. The 'movable' is part of the
	  mesh wrapper and the one in csThing should not be used.
	- csThing no longer implements iVisibilityObject as the mesh wrapper
	  already does this.
	- Removed MarkVisible() and related functions from csThing.
	- Removed sky and template flags from csThing. Sky support will soon
	  be reimplemented using render order techniques.
	- Removed zbufMode from csThing. This is part of mesh wrapper.
	- Made csThing::Draw() and DrawCurves() smarter. If a thing cannot
	  move (which is default and occurs a lot) these functions will not
	  try to use the movable anymore. This makes it a bit more efficient.
	- Removed csLight::CalculateLighting() for csThing.
	- Also removed csSector::ShineLights() for a csThing.
	- Fixed a bug in the use of csPortal::CompleteSector(). When this
	  function returns false all routines will now correctly stop
	  processing that portal.
	- Fixed a bug in infinite maze (-infinite option of WalkTest) which
	  makes it work a little better but still not good enough (still
	  crashes when trying to complete the first sector).
	- Added iVisibilityCuller::Setup(). This function will setup the
	  visibility culler. It replaces csThing::BuildStaticTree().
	- Removed iSector::CreateBSP().
	- Added a parameter to csSector::UseStaticTree() which indicates
	  the mesh object to use for visibility culling. In addition the
	  STATBSP keyword in map files now requires an additional parameter
	  which is the name of the mesh object to use for visibility culling.
	  At this moment the only way to use this is to have a thing mesh
	  object and add the VISTREE() flag to that.
	- Renamed csSector::static_thing to culler_mesh. Also made it a
	  mesh wrapper instead of a thing.
	- I disabled a lot of more of the octree debugging stuff in WalkTest.
	  This is all broken now.
	- Removed the 'things' console command. It is broken now and needs
	  to be replaced with something more general.
	- Renamed STATBSP to CULLER. This is more accurate.
	- Renamed csSector::UseStaticTree() to UseCuller().
	- Stared work on render priority system. The engine will keep a list
	  of all named render priorities (to avoid using numbers by the
	  objects). Internally every render priority name corresponds with
	  a number. In every sector objects are rendered sorting on this
	  render priority (low numbers first). In future it will also be
	  possible to render all objects of the same priority using some
	  other sorting criterium (like material or distance to camera for
	  transparent objects). There are always four predefined named
	  render queues. They are called 'sky' (2), 'wall' (4), 'object' (6),
	  and 'alpha' (8). The values between the brackets are the default
	  values of those queues.
	- Added SetRenderPriority() and GetRenderPriority() to iMeshWrapper.
	- Added RegisterRenderPriority(), GetRenderPriority(), and
	  ClearRenderPriorities() to csEngine.
	- Added RENDERPRIORITIES section in world file. There you can define
	  the names of priority queus which can then be used for all objects.
	  This command causes all previously defined render priority queues
	  to be undefined except for sky, wall, object, and alpha. These
	  will be preset to the default values of (2, 4, 6, or 8).
	- Added support for PRIORITY keyword in MESHOBJ. For a MESHOBJ
	  the default depends on other settings. If ZFILL is given for the
	  object the default will be 'wall'. If ZNONE or CAMERA is given
	  the default will be 'sky'. If ZTEST is given the default is
	  'alpha'. Otherwise the default is 'object'.
	- Other than all the support above render priorities are still not
	  used by the engine.
	- Fixed csclear library so that it compiles.
8-Apr-2001
	- Extended iPortal with SetPortalSectorCallback() to set a callback
	  that is called whenever a sector for a portal is missing. This
	  callback will get either a reference to a iRenderView (when drawing),
	  a iFrustumView (when doing CheckFrustum) or else NULL (for HitBeam).
	- Changed csPortal::CompleteSector() to a function which
	  completes the sector using the new callback above.
	- Added CheckFrustum() to iPortal.
	- Added iPolygon3D::CreateNullPortal() to create a NULL portal
	  (a portal pointing to a NULL sector).
	- Added iFrustumView::StartNewShadowBlock().
	- Added iFrustumView::CopyFrustumContext() and SetFrustumContext().
	  These functions are specifically used to be able to remember
	  the current context and restore it later.
	- Using all the above I tried to fix infinite maze but it still
	  crashes somewhere. Will look at this later.
	- Same for -huge option. It compiles but doesn't work (but I suspect
	  it wasn't working before either: todo for later).
	- Fixed WalkTest to use mesh wrappers instead of csThing.
	- Removed csSector::Prepare() as this is no longer needed (Prepare()
	  is called transparently by the thing).
	- Removed csEngine::PrepareSectors().
	- Removed support for things and skies in csSector. Only mesh objects
	  are supported now.
	- Removed csPolyIt and csCurveIt (polygon and curve iterators) in
	  csEngine. Since polygons and curves are private to things these
	  iterators don't make sense anymore.
	- Side note: in the process of this entire engine redesign many
	  debug commands in WalkTest are broken now. They will probably
	  be resurrected soon.
	- Side note: radiosity is now broken too!
	- Removed the list of skies, things, and thing templates from
	  the engine and all functions related to those (like FindThing(),
	  ...).
	- Fixed several other apps to the change from things to mesh objects.
	- Also fixed MazeD so that it compiles again but MazeD is now getting
	  more and more broken. MazeD can only revive if it gets the ability
	  to edit mesh plugins (preferably through other plugins as well).
	- Martin Geisse updated the sound system documentation.
	- Martin fixed the garbled output from streamed sound in ds3d.
	- Norman Kramer added interfaces iSprite2DUVAnimation and
	  iSprite2DUVAnimationFrame. Also extended iSprite2DState
	  and iSprite2DFactoryState accordingly. With those new interfaces
	  it is now possible to do UV animation (texture coordinate
	  animation) for 2D sprites.
	- Norman added ANIMATE keyword to the spr2d object to select
	  an uv animation.
	- Norman also documented UV animation for 2D sprites and added
	  an example.
7-Apr-2001
	- Renamed MESHOBJ to MESHFACT in the map file format wherever
	  a mesh factory is wanted. This is less confusing.
	  This affects library and map files.
	- Fixed a bug in the thing loader when there is no default material
	  specified in the thing itself but only in the polygon.
	- Completely converted flarge to use mesh objects alone.
	- Removed all support for THING, SIXFACE, and SKY keywords in
	  the standard loader. This means that sky objects are now no longer
	  supported. To implement sky objects in the future we will use the
	  proposed render order setting for mesh objects in general. This
	  is a todo for later (but not long from now).
	- The old LoadThing() to load a thing from a file is replaced
	  with a LoadMeshObject() that can be used to load any mesh object
	  in general. For LoadThingTemplate() to load a thing template you can
	  use LoadMeshObjectFactory() instead.
	- Removed all obsolete token keywords from the default loader.
	- Fixed a bug in LoadMeshObjectFactory(). It was deleting all loaded
	  plugins for nothing.
	- Changed csPolygon3D::UpdateVertexLighting() to use iLight instead
	  of csLight and extended iPolygon3D with UpdateVertexLighting().
	  This is also a temporary function though.
	- Added GetPolygon(name) to iThingState.
	- Converted Blocks to use mesh objects instead of csThing directly.
	- GetRadius() and GetObjectBoundingBox() in iMeshObject of csThing
	  are now correct.
	- Martin Geisse did some clean-up work in the image loader.
6-Apr-2001
	- Martin Geisse did the first changes towards moving csparser to
	  a plugin:
	    - Added iLoaderNew interface which should finally replace iLoader
	      (in imap/parser.h).
	    - csLoader no more contains only static member functions. It is
	      also an implementation of iLoaderNew. In the end the static
	      member should all disappear. In the meantime, it csLoader
	      contains a static pointer to an instance of that class, as
	      soon as an instance is created. This is used by the static
	      functions to access non-static functions. This means that if you
	      want to use csLoader functions, even static functions, you
	      should first create an instance of it. You should do this
	      by loading it as a plug-in. The plug-in must be statically
	      registered (e.g. with REGISTER_STATIC_LIBRARY).
	    - Changed the load_image function to a plugin method (as the
	      first of all).
	    - Changed the applications to match the above rules.
	- Martin Geisse fixed a bug in cctest.
	- Martin fixed a bug in csstring.
	- Martin fixed a bug with the ball mesh plugin. He added the missing
	  do_clip parameter in csBallMeshObject::Draw().
	- Martin removed some unneeded dependencies on csgfx.
	- Philip Wyett fixed a bug in simple.
	- Philip updated MingW package version number to 0.20.
	- Wouter Wijngaards added /usr/lib/crystalspace to the installation
	  search for the unix driver.
	- Fixed a bug in drawing of things which are represented in the
	  mesh object system. The movable is now taken from the mesh
	  wrapper.
	- Fixed bug in lighting of things (CheckFrustum). The movable
	  is now a parameter to CheckFrustum.
	- Fixed lighting for mesh object things used in a BSP tree as well.
	- Added new iMaterialList interface and let csMaterialList implement
	  it.
	- Fixed SCF declarations for csMaterialWrapper. It was using
	  DECLARE_IBASE() when it should have used
	  DECLARE_IBASE_EXT (csPObject).
	- Added iEngine::GetMaterialList().
	- Extended iThingState with ReplaceMaterials().
	- Using all of the above I implemented material sets in the
	  thing loader plugin.
	- Added support for SKYDOME keyword in thing loader plugin.
	- Removed support for TEXTURE statement in bezier template loader.
	  I have absolutely no idea why it was there but it was making
	  life difficult for me :-)
	- Moved loading of bezier templates from THING to WORLD level where
	  it belongs. The new CURVE command in THING will no longer load the
	  template but instead make a curve based on a named curve template.
	- Curved surfaces are fully working again (also with HARDMOVE).
	  It was a combination of several bugs that prevented the donut
	  in flarge from looking ok.
	- Added temporary CreateBezierTemplate() and FindCurveTemplate()
	  functions to iEngine. These are going to be used for a new addon
	  that loads bezier templates in the engine. Later bezier templates
	  will move to the thing plugin itself and then these functions
	  can be removed.
	- Changed crystalspace.mesh.loader.plane to
	  crystalspace.mesh.loader.thing.plane.
	- Added new bezier loader and saver to the thing loader plugin.
	  Bezier curve templates now have to be loaded through the ADDON
	  system as well (using crystalspace.mesh.loader.thing.bezier).
	- Added SetVertex() to iCurveTemplate.
	- Added iThingState::CreateCurve() to create a curve for a thing
	  from a given curve template.
	- Added iThingState::AddCurveVertex().
	- These changes make the thing loader plugin complete (except for
	  saving which is not implemented yet).
	- Removed support for loading BEZIER curve templates from the
	  standard loader. This should now be done using the ADDON
	  mechanism described above. Update flarge for these changes. Look
	  there for an example.
	- Fixed a bug in HARDMOVE command for mesh objects in loader. This
	  bug would cause things to be transformed wrong (at least their
	  transformation matrix) when used as a mesh object. It also affected
	  other mesh objects.
	- Added a new optional PLUGINS section to the world file. With that
	  you can give shorter names to plugins. This shorter name can be
	  used later in PLUGIN (...) statements instead of
	  'crystalspace.mesh.loader...'. The long plugin name is stil.
	  supported. Also note that a plugin will only be loaded if used.
	  So you can safely mention all plugins in the PLUGINS statement.
	  They will not be loaded until used.
	- Discovered that nearly all of the mesh loaders forgot to call
	  SetFactory().
	- Made the thing loader a bit easier with regards to the difference
	  between loading a mesh object and mesh object factory. For csThing
	  there is no difference. The difference is only in how the thing
	  is used in the engine. This means that things are the only mesh
	  objects that don't need a factory for creation.
	- Extended a hack in csloader with another temporary hack so that
	  portals in thing mesh objects are actually resolved to the right
	  sector. We need a better solution for this. Not sure how yet.
	- Added 'link' parameter to iEngine::CreateSector(). By default this
	  is true. When link is true the created sector will be added to the
	  list of sectors of the engine. This should be set to false if
	  you want to create a temporary sector that should not be added
	  to the engine sector list. A good example of this is when the
	  portal command generates a dummy sector that is resolved later.
	- Fixed collision detection bug in walktest. Walktest was trying
	  to query the csMeshWrapper for iPolygonMesh. It should query
	  the mesh object that is in the wrapper instead.
	- Extended csSector::IntersectSegment() to also look at things
	  inside mesh wrappers. This is an ugly solution and as many things
	  I'm doing these days it begs for a better solution. But first
	  getting things working again...
	- Also added initialization of collision detection for meshes
	  inside sectors. Now thing meshes will have proper collision
	  detection as well.
	- Added Yet Another Ugly Hack so that the engine will see if a thing
	  (inside a mesh wrapper) has CS_THING_VISTREE set and then use
	  that for visibility culling. People, keep in mind that all these
	  hacks are temporary :-)
5-Apr-2001
	- Fixed a bug in iPortal which prevented proper linking of all
	  CS apps on some platforms.
	- Fixed compile problem for python plugin.
	- Added the concept of general loader plugins to the loader. With
	  the new 'ADDON' keyword you can now use any loader plugin in
	  general. This can be used for loading game entities for example.
	  ADDON is supported for WORLD, LIBRARY, SECTOR, MESHOBJ (both as
	  factory and object), and TERROBJ (both as factory and object).
	  ADDON will in the future also be supported for COLLECTION and
	  NODE. The Parse() function in the plugin will be called with the
	  given parent object as the context.
	- The Parse() function for mesh and terrain loader plugins will now
	  also be called with the wrapper object as context. Unfortunatelly
	  this breaks a fix from Michael Voase which allowed the setting
	  of actions on 3D sprites loaded with the impexp importers.
	- Added 'SetFactory()' to iMeshWrapper.
	- Added 'GetPrivateObject()' to iMeshFactoryWrapper.
	- Fixed some ugliness in csparser where it would have to find the
	  original factory again after loading a mesh object. All loader
	  plugins are now responsible for setting the factory itself. They
	  can do this now because they receive the wrapper pointer as a
	  context.
	- Managed to re-fix the problem with actions being usable in
	  combination with models loaded as 3DS or MDL. This is a temporary
	  fix until these loaders have moved to a plugin but for now it
	  will do.
	- Created iPolyTxtPlane interface and let csPolyTxtPlane implement
	  it.
	- Added temporary CreatePolyTxtPlane() and FindPolyTxtPlane()
	  functions in iEngine. These will be used until these planes are
	  managed by the thing plugin.
	- Implemented plane loader and saver (saver not working yet). Planes
	  are a bit special. They are objects that should be private to the
	  thing mesh object system (they are only used by things) so the
	  engine should not manage them. However planes can be shared accross
	  several thing meshes so it is not suitable to make them private
	  to one thing mesh either. So planes will be loaded by a general
	  (non-mesh object) loader plugin. This plugin is closely associated
	  to the thing loaders (implemented by the same shared library)
	  so it knows how to create planes for things. In the future planes
	  will be kept by the thing type plugin itself (global to all things).
	  For now this loader will load the planes in the engine.
	- Removed support for PLANE in library and world. Planes now have
	  to be loaded using the ADDON keyword and the
	  crystalspace.mesh.loader.plane plugin.
	- Added iPolygon3D::SetTextureSpace() with iPolyTxtPlane* as a
	  parameter.
	- Added SCF interfaces: iPolyTexType, iPolyTexNone, iPolyTexFlat,
	  iPolyTexGouraud, and iPolyTexLightMap. They are implemented by
	  csPolyTexType, csPolyTexNone, csPolyTexFlat, csPolyTexGouraud,
	  and csPolyTexLightMap respectively.
	- Added GetPolyTexType() to iPolygon3D.
	- Using the above interfaces I fixed the thing loader to correctly
	  load texture mapping information (lightmapping, gouraud shading,
	  flat shading, ...)
	- Extended the loader with HARDMOVE for mesh objects.
	- The thing loader plugin is still not working correctly but we
	  are getting there.
	- Added polygon ID which I will use for caching the lightmaps
	  instead of the old sector/thing/ID way. This will mean that
	  adding a polygon to a level will invalidate a lot of lightmaps
	  but on the other hand it is safer and easier. The previous
	  method depended on things and sectors having unique names.
	- Added curve ID as well for a similar reason.
	- Changed caching of lightmaps for polygons and curves using the
	  new ID system.
	- The above change fixes a bug where things loaded with the thing
	  loader plugin would not correctly behave with regards to the lighting
	  cache because those things don't have a name (their name is inside
	  the mesh wrapper instead).
	- The thing loader now works a lot better. There is still a problem
	  with movable things (as you can see from the new version of flarge
	  that I committed). The problem is that there is still a movable
	  instance in csThing itself which is used instead of the correct
	  movable in csMeshWrapper.
	- Michael Voase did the following:
	    - Document discovered bug in csloader.cpp / crossbuild.
	    - Fixed documentation bug in phyztest. Now displays
  	      instructions on the tab, del and enter keys.
	    - Fixed bug where QUERY_INTERFACE was being called
  	      on a mesh wrapper.
	    - Fixed bug where incorrect object was being used in
  	      collision detection. Now extracts the csThing from
  	      the sector where the walls are stored.
	- Bob Ham fixed several errors in the documentation.
	- Martin Geisse fixed another compiler error in ptlab.
	- Christopher Nelson fixed source code formatting errors in his CSWS
	  patches.
4-Apr-2001
	- Started work on thing loader and saver. Although things haven't
	  moved to a plugin yet it is already possible to make real
	  plugins from the loader and saver.
	- Moved the CS_THING_... flags from csThing header to iThingState
	  header.
	- Extended iThingState with GetFlags(), SetFlags(), SetMovingOption(),
	  GetMovingOption(),  GetCurvesScale(), SetCurvesScale(),
	  GetCurvesCenter(), SetCurvesCenter(), CurveVertex(), CurveTexel(),
	  GetNumCurveVertices(), GetCurveVertices(), GetNumCurves(),
	  GetCurve(), and MergeTemplate().
	- Extended iPolygon3D with GetMaterial(), GetVertexIndices(),
	  GetTextureType(), SetTextureType(), GetCosinusFactor(),
	  SetCosinusFactor(), and a few additional versions of
	  SetTextureSpace().
	- Added new csPolygon3D::CopyTextureType() (and also added this to
	  iPolygon3D). This function will copy the texture information from
	  a given polygon to this polygon. Note that the material itself
	  is not copied. Only the information on how to apply the texture
	  mapping.
	- Extended iMaterialWrapper with GetMaterial().
	- Moved the POLYTXT_... flags from csPolygon3D header to iPolygon3D
	  header.
	- Also moved CS_POLY_COLLDET.
	- Added iEngine::GetThingType().
	- Added iCurve and iCurveTemplate SCF interfaces and let csCurve
	  and csCurveTemplate implement them.
	- Removed 'default_texlen' from csThing::MergeTemplate() since it
	  wasn't working.
	- Removed the csThing::MergeTemplate() version which also replaced
	  materials. Instead added new csThing::ReplaceMaterials() function
	  which does the same thing (except merge). So where you would
	  use MergeTemplate() in the past (the version that replaces
	  materials) you will now use the other MergeTemplate() and then
	  call ReplaceMaterials().
	- Changed csThing::MergeTemplate() to work on SCF interfaces
	  (iThingState, iMaterialWrapper, ...).
	- The thing loader compiles now but is far from complete and usable.
	- Made access to flags in iPolygon3D and iThing more consistant
	  so that it works like iPortal. There is now a 'GetFlags()' which
	  returns an object of type csFlags.
	- Added iPortal::SetWarp(csTransform&).
	- Added support for portals in the thing loader.
	- Added support for setting materials in the thing loader.
	- Added support for CIRCLE command in the thing loader.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a silly typographical error in csHashCompute()
	  which rendered the function almost completely inoperative.
	- Martin Geisse fixed a bug in csPrefixConfig.
3-Apr-2001
	- Norman Kramer fixed a warning about explicit initialization
	  of iBase in copy constructor of csCamera.
	- Norman Kramer fixed a batch of warnings about conversions and
	  comparisons in the software sound renderer.
	- Created new iThingState interface and let csThing implement it.
	  iThingState is almost the same as iThing but with extras.
	  iThing will probably be removed in the future.
	- Fixed a bug in csThing::MergeTemplate(). It would not correctly
	  copy the new zbufMode flags.
	- Removed 'sector' member from curves. Removed 'sector' parameter
	  from csThing::MergeTemplate(). Removed 'sector' parameter from
	  load_thing() and load_thing_part().
	- Removed 'sector' from csPolygon3D::Finish() and csThing::Prepare().
	- Removed the ability to have ambient settings per sector. This was
	  never used and I don't think it is very useful either. Ambient
	  settings are now global and still stored in csLight.
	  csSector::SetAmbientColor() and GetAmbientColor() are now gone.
	- Removed 'engine' member from csThing and also removed 'engine'
	  parameter to csThing.
	- Created a new csThingObjectType class which is the mesh object
	  type class for things. For now it is not in a plugin yet but
	  embedded inside csEngine. Added csEngine::GetThingType() to fetch
	  the reference to this type. This is a temporary function.
	- Added csEngine::CreateSectorWallsMesh() which is similar to
	  CreateSectorWalls() but creates a thing as a mesh object instead
	  of a normal thing.
	- Avoided the use of csFrustumView in csThing. Now uses iFrustumView.
	- Avoided the use of csFrustumView in csSector. Now uses iFrustumView.
	- Added csLight::CalculateLighting() for iMeshWrapper. This will
	  query if iThingState is known.
	- Added csSector::ShineLights() for iMeshWrapper.
	- Added iFrustumView::SetDynamic() and IsDynamic().
	- Added iMovable parameter to csThing::AppendShadows().
	- Extended iSector interface with GetRecLevel().
	- It is now possible to use things through the mesh object API. When
	  this is done the mesh wrapper takes control of some of the issues
	  (like where the thing is positioned, what the Z-buf mode is,
	  the entity flags, ...). The similar items in csThing are ignored
	  (and will later be removed when csThing moves to a plugin).
	  Note that things added through the mesh object API will not be
	  included in the 'things' arrays that you can find in both csEngine
	  and csSector. Instead they are added to the 'meshes' arrays like
	  all other mesh objects. Note that in the short future the support
	  for the 'things' array will be removed.
	- Lighting on things which are added through the mesh object API
	  will now also work. For now this is solved by the engine recognizing
	  this as a special case of mesh objects (by checking if iThingState
	  is implemented). In the future the engine should now know about
	  iThingState so we need a more general solution. For now it will do.
	- Converted simple to use the new iThingState and use things as
	  if they are mesh objects. This seems to work very well.
	- Christopher Nelson <paradox@BBHC.ORG> did the following changes
	  to CSWS:
	    - Fixed silly problems in csButton with textures and bitmaps
	      drawing wrong.  
	    - Fixed ugliness with texturing not moving with the button on
	      shiftable buttons. 
	    - Fixed artifacting problem with csButton not drawing correctly
	      when the whole parent window is a transparent bitmap.
	    - Fixed bug with button not immediately redrawing when
	      highlighted (in case there's a visual change) .
	    - Changed drawing of all buttons so that the currently
	      highlighted button's text draws in a lighter color than
	      other buttons.
2-Apr-2001
	- Norman Kramer did the following to CSWS:
	    - csGrid now has a cursor (3 types: row, column or cell cursor).
	    - csGrid notifies its parent if the cursor changed.
	    - csGridView has a new border that is colored differently
	      based on the active state of the gridview.
	    - Added GetStringAt() to csGrid.
	- Michael Voase did the following:
	    - Added iBase parameter to iLoaderPlugIn::Parse() command.
	    - Added factory passing between LoadMeshObjectFactory()
  	      in csloader and spr3dldr.
	    - Corrects bug with sprite frames and smoothing.
	- Renamed csSector::GetVisibleThings() to GetVisibleObjects() and
	  let it return a list of general objects instead of only things.
	- Added csMeshWrapper::GetWorldBoundingBox() to calculate the bounding
	  box of a mesh object in world space. This function will also cache
	  the bounding box.
	- Renamed CS_ENTITY_VISTREE to CS_THING_VISTREE. Moved all remaining
	  CS_ENTITY_... flags from thing.h to meshobj.h. They will now be
	  global to both things and mesh objects (useful when things are later
	  merged with mesh objects).
	- csLoader will now also recognize the flags: NOLIGHTING, NOSHADOWS,
	  BACK2FRONT, INVISIBLE, DETAIL, CAMERA, and CONVEX for mesh
	  objects. They are currently ignored.
	- Implemented INVISIBLE and CAMERA flags for mesh objects.
	- Extended iMeshObject::Draw() with an extra zbuf mode parameter
	  to control what Z-buffer drawing mode to use (NONE, FILL, USE,
	  or TEST). USE is default.
	- Extended all mesh plugins to implement this mode.
	- Added zbufMode flag to csMeshWrapper and two functions to access
	  it (SetZBufMode() and GetZBufMode()). The mesh object will be drawn
	  with this mode.
	- Also added zbufMode and same functions to csThing. This means that
	  you can now let things be drawn using mode NONE and TEST as well
	  (this was not possible in the past).
	- Extended iParticle with a zbufMode parameter as well.
	- Extended the loader to recognize the keywords ZNONE, ZUSE, and
	  ZTEST in addition to ZFILL for both things and mesh objects.
	- Added 'imgload' to the 'make walkall' target.
	- Added nine new console commands to walktest to demonstrate the new
	  full screen effects. The commands are: fs_inter, fs_red, fs_green,
	  fs_blue, fs_whiteout, fs_fadecol, fs_fadeout, fs_fadetxt, and
	  fs_shadevert. Note that fs_fadetxt does not seem to work well
	  with OpenGL. Probably a limitation in DrawPolygonFX. Also note
	  that fs_fadetxt and fs_fadecol do work in software but since the
	  software renderer is limited to five steps of alpha (0%, 25%, 50%,
	  75%, and 100%) there is no smooth transition. Also assigned
	  F4 to fs_inter, F5 to fs_fadeout, and F6 to fs_fadetxt spark.
	- Integrated patches from Bob Ham to compile Crystal Space on
	  the Hurd operating system.
	- Bob also did some proofreading of the docs and did a few
	  corrections.
        - Integrated patches from Christopher Nelson <paradox@BBHC.ORG> for
	  CSWS. With these patches csws components get a notification when
	  the mouse enters or leaves a component. There is also a new
	  notification message that is called when a component is deleted.
1-Apr-2001
	- Martin Geisse split up the csgfxldr library into two parts. The
	  first part contains the image classes and now exists as the csgfx
	  library. The second part contains the image file loaders and now
	  exists as a plugin.
	- Philip Wyett fixed demosky, perftest, pysimp, simple, simplep,
	  video app, and phyztest for the new image loader plugin.
	- Philip also added new image loader to required MSVCGEN process.
	- Norman Kramer added video/loader to the plugins to build by default.
	- Norman delayed query of imageloader in the fancy concole. Its now
	  requested on a SystemOpen event.
	- Norman made destructor in imgload.cpp virtual.
	  Made a DYNLIB.IMGLOAD where the -lpng and -ljpeg is collected
	  (bet Eric wont like it, but it works for now).
	- Norman removed some remaining gfx includes.
31-Mar-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards did the following for the spr3d plugin:
	    - Added GetChildren to iSkeletonLimb scf interface, to make
	      complete access possible.
	    - Added Sprite3DFactorySaver and Sprite3DSaver.
	      Please note that the SMOOTH(...) information is lost. The
	      value read is not stored in memory.
	- Wouter also added FountainFactorySaver, FountainSaver,
	  RainFactorySaver, RainSaver, SnowFactorySaver, SnowSaver,
	  SpiralFactorySaver and SpiralSaver plugins.
	- Wouter added Sprite2DFactorySaver and Sprite2DSaver.
	- Wouter added a new csfx full screen effects file. It contains
	  various nice full screen visual effects.
	    - For drawing interference on the screen.
	    - For fading out the screen (to black).
	    - For fading to a picture.
	    - For fading to a chosen color.
	    - Emulating the old green-only monitors.
  	      (als red or blue can be used).
	    - Creating a white-out effect.
	    - Creating a vertical shading (nice for backgrounds).
	    - And a multipurpose screendpfx routine.
	  All these routines try to use the 3d hardware efficiently.
	- Martin Geisse first changed the system driver to ignore plugins
	  with no class ID in the config file instead of printing an error.
	  This is needed if one plugin loads another by a line in its
	  config file, so the user can override this line with a no-value
	  line.
	- Martin then proceeded to revert the above change because it is
	  useless. Adding plug-ins in a plugin-specific config file is not
	  the right way. Sorry for this.
29-Mar-2001
	- Martin Geisse added a note about the use of C++ templates
	  to the documentation.
	- Let csSector::CheckFrustum() work through iVisibilityCuller::
	  CastShadows(). This is another stip in the rewrite. Moved all
	  static_thing specific frustum code (i.e. the traversal of the
	  octree) from csSector to csThing.
28-Mar-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards added GetNumberParticles and GetSource methods
	  to the spiral particle system SCF interface.
	- Wouter also added the following methods to the rain particle
	  system scf interface: GetNumberParticles, GetDropSize, GetBox,
	  GetLighting, GetFallSpeed.
	- Wouter added the following methods to the snow particle system
	  scf interface: GetNumberParticles, GetDropSize, GetBox,
	  GetLighting, GetFallSpeed, GetSwirl.
	- Philip Wyett added necessary fontserver plugin to test app.
	- Finished the split of csFrustumView and csFrustumContext.
	- Fixed a bug in the sprite loader with regards to skeletal sprites.
	- Added a normal sprite, a skeletal sprite, and the hierarchical
	  robot to flarge.
	- Added 'meshes' target to 'walkall'.
	- Philip Wyett attempted to fix a heap-related crasher in skel3d.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine reverted all of Philip Wyett's changes to skel3d.cpp
	  since they were incorrect and introduced several memory leaks.  The
	  problem was that Philip was addressing the symptom rather than the
	  bug itself.  Instead, I (Eric) repaired this heap-related crasher by
	  eliminating the actual bug.  In this case, the bug was that
	  csSkelLimbState's `name' instance variable was never being
	  initialized, and the uninitialized value was later being sent to
	  free().
27-Mar-2001
	- Philip Wyett eliminated VC6 compiler warning about empty control
	  statement.
	- Philip also did some code cleanup in the video plugins.
	- Norman Kramer added precalculations in csCamera to save a few
	  multiplications in Rotate and RotateWorld.
	- Norman also made config file keys case insensitive.
	- Wouter Wijngaards added end of line to canvas font server warning.
26-Mar-2001
	- Philip Wyett did some minor updates to the docs.
25-Mar-2001:
	- Removed iShadowSystem and merged its functionality with
	  iVisibilityCuller. iShadowCaster and iShadowReceiver are still
	  there but (logically) depend on iVisibilityObject now.
	- Started iFrustumView SCF interface for csFrustumView.
	- Fundamentally changed the way csFrustumView works. Added a
	  csFrustumContext which is changing for every recursion level.
	  csFrustumView remains constant now. This way csFrustumView works
	  in a similar way to csRenderView (and csRenderContext).
	- Philip Wyett fixed runtime memory reference error in csconin.cpp
	  under windows.
	- Philip Wyett fixed null reference error in csconin.cpp under Windows.
	- Eric Sunshine reverted above change to csconin.cpp by Philip Wyett
	  since Philip's change was incorrect.  Eric applied the correct fix
	  instead.
	- Eric Sunshine applied a patch to csNodeIterator which was sent to the
	  mailing list by Malcolm Peacock <malcolm@mpeacock.demon.co.uk> on
	  August 13, 2000.  This patch fixes a problem where the csNodeIterator
	  bug was always one element out-of-step with the actual underlying
	  csObject iterator.  The symptom of the bug was that
	  csNodeIterator::IsFinished() reported the end of iteration one
	  element too early.
	- Eric Sunshine renamed iConsoleOutput::SystemExtension(va_list) to
	  SystemExtensionV() since some compilers failed to grok the overload.
	- Martin Geisse changed the way walktest determines the word path.
	  If the path begins with a slash, it is considered an absolute path
	  and copied. Otherwise '/lev/' is prepended.
	- Philip Wyett did the following changes to docs:
	    - Update all docs to point to the new location at 3ddownloads.
	    - Removed refs to old/no longer needed MingW files.
	    - Updated links to DOS Nasm and other support files,
	      with respect to new location at 3D Downloads.
24-Mar-2001:
	- Further changes to avoid using world space coordinate system.
	- Made all the members in csFrustumView private and added accessor
	  functions.
	- Created new csLightingInfo class which holds all information specific
	  to lighting and CheckFrustum. This information used to be in
	  csFrustumView but csFrustumView is supposed to be independent
	  of 'lighting'.
	- csThing now implements iShadowSystem.
	- Philip Wyett added Python plugin to MingW build process. This
	- Eric Sunshine reverted Philip Wyett's changes to cspython.mak for a
	  couple of reasons.  First, as Philip mentioned in his log message,
	  his changes were a bit of a hack.  Second, they actually broke the
	  makefile with unbalanced instances of if/else/endif.  Instead, I
	  generalized the makefile so that it should be able to handle Python
	  via Mingw without any special hacks.
	- Philip Wyett added Python plugin to MingW build process.  This
	  addition also adds the compilation of CS Python test app, thanks
	  to Unix makefile system.  Edited 'cspython.mak' in order to allow
	  MingW to build the Python plugin correctly.  Is a bit of a hack.
	  Eric will probably find a more elegant way... :-)
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the project:
	    - Repaired an ultra nasty bug in csSystemDriver::LoadPlugIn().
	      This bug has been present since the introduction of SCF on
	      November 5, 1999.  Rather than returning the explicitly requested
	      SCF interface, LoadPlugIn() was _always_ returning the plugin's
	      iPlugIn interface.  The problem was further compounded by the
	      LOAD_PLUGIN() macro which then performed a blind cast of the
	      returned pointer to the requested type, with the result that a
	      completely bogus pointer was being returned to the caller.  It
	      was only by pure luck that this problem was not noticed earlier.
	      It remained hidden because, up until now, all SCF interfaces
	      implemented by plugin modules have themselves inherited from
	      iPlugIn.  Thus, by pure chance, the returned iPlugIn pointer also
	      happened to be the correct pointer to the requested type.
	      However, if embedding or multiple-inheritance is instead used to
	      implement iPlugIn, then the one-to-one pointer relationship no
	      longer applies and the application crashes on account of receipt
	      of a pointer to iPlugIn when it was expecting something entirely
	      other.
	    - Renamed iConsole to iConsoleOutput for consistency with existing
	      iConsoleInput.
	    - The iConsoleInput and iConsoleOutput interfaces no longer
	      incorrectly inherit from iPlugIn.  This was incorrect because it
	      made the assumption that anything implementing these interfaces
	      _must_ also be a plug-in module.  This was an unnecessary
	      restriction.
	    - Relocated plugins/cscon to plugins/console/output/standard.
	    - Renamed csConsole to csConsoleOutput.
	    - Relocated plugins/simpcon to plugins/console/output/simple.
	    - Renamed csSimpleInput to csConsoleInput and moved the related
	      implementation files from plugins/simpcon to
	      plugins/console/input/standard.  This implementation now resides
	      in its own plug-in module rather than being bundled with the
	      `simple' output console.
	    - Relocated the `funky' console from plugins/cscon to
	      plugins/console/output/fancy.  This console is now a stand-alone
	      plug-in module rather than being bundled with `cscon'.  Instead
	      of inheriting directly from csConsoleOutput, it now loads and
	      utilizes the csConsoleOutput plugin.
	    - Renamed funConsole to csFancyConsole.
	    - Renamed funcon.cfg to fancycon.cfg.
	    - Renamed funcon.zip to fancycon.zip.
	    - Fixed several positional computation bugs in csFancyConsole.
	- Eric Sunshine modified jobber.pl so that it now batches CVS `add' and
	  `remove' operations rather than invoking them indiviudally for each
	  file or directory added to, or removed from the repository.  This
	  speeds up the script significantly when many files need to be added
	  and removed since the old method of invoking a CVS command for each
	  file was quite slow on account of the fact that a new session with
	  both the SSH and CVS servers had to be initiated for every single
	  file.  Takes special care to add directories before files, and also
	  batches binary files separately from text files so that `-kb' can be
	  applied as appropriate.
	- Eric Sunshine removed the `coord' file from standard.zip since that
	  was an inappropriate location for that file.  standard.zip is a
	  static, system-level library which should be considered (and may very
	  well be) read-only.  `coord' on the other hand, is a user-level file
	  which dynamically changes each time the user asks WalkTest to record
	  its camera position.  Instead of expecting `coord' to be in either of
	  the VFS volumes /this or /lib/std, WalkTest now expects to find it in
	  /temp.  Also renamed `coord' to `walktest.cam'.  Likewise, renamed
	  `coord.bug' to `walktest.bug'.  This file has also been relocated
	  from /this to /temp.
	- Martin Geisse made the following changes:
	    - Walktest no more plays unrecognized sounds in loop mode
	      at startup.
	    - Moved the 'coord' file to standard.zip.
	    - The system driver now prints debug messages on calls to
	      Initialize(), Open(), Close() and the destructor.
	    - The initial debug level can now be set in the command line.
	- Norman Kramer fixed an iConsole -> iConsoleOutput reference in a
	  couple files which Eric missed.
23-Mar-2001:
	- Wouter Wijngaards made 'make win32gcc' correctly detect the
	  presence of a bash (or other) shell used by the makefile system.
	  It will then autoconfigure for that. If run from command prompt,
	  it will configure for that.
	- Wouter also added Get methods to iParticleState for the
	  ChangeRotation, ChangeSize, ChangeColor, ChangeAlpha and so.
	- Philip Wyett did some re-work of MingW docs to take account of
	  new all in one CS MingW package...
	- Did an optimization in the CheckFrustum routines. It was apparantly
	  doing a copy of every polygon without actually using that copy.
	- Changed the polygon handling functions in CheckFrustum to use object
	  space instead of world space. For bsp type polygons (for visibility
	  testing of object) world space == object space and for normal
	  polygons this is also true for all things that are merged in a
	  bsp tree.
	- Added csThing::GetBoundingBox() which takes a movable and calculates
	  a bounding box based on the object space bounding box and that
	  movable. It will automatically cache the bounding box so that when
	  the object doesn't move nothing is recalculated.
	- By using this new GetBoundingBox() function I completely avoided
	  the use of world space coordinates for things in csSector which is
	  as it should be.
22-Mar-2001:
	- Rewrote the CheckFrustum and shadow stuff so that most of it now
	  uses the SCF interfaces instead of the classes.
	- Wouter Wijngaards added a host of Get methods to the fountain
	  mesh plugin.
	- Norman Kramer did a few fixes to the sound renderer:
	    - Replaced / with \ in #include directive.
	    - Fixed virtual destructor.
	    - Fixed vpath in makefile.
	- Martin Geisse split up the sound loader into several plugins.
	  There is now one loader plugin for every sound format, plus one
	  plugin that lets all others look like a single loader for
	  convenience (called multiplexer). Currently all these plugins
	  remain in the sndload library.
21-Mar-2001:
	- Martin Geisse did a big redesign and cleanup of the sound system:
	    - Merged static and streamed sound data classes.
	    - Sound data must now be registered before playing to get a
	      sound handle -- just like textures.
	    - When playing streamed sounds, all sound sources created from
	      the same sound handle always play the same sequence at the
	      same time.
	    - Moved common stuff of all renderers together in
	      plugins/sound/renderers/common.
	- Removed a few unneeded includes to lview.h. As few things as
	  possible should include that file since we're going to do
	  that through SCF soon.
	- Reverted the fix from Philip to python plugin and did the fix the
	  'right' way.  Please don't modify cs_pyth.cpp directly.  It is an
	  automatically generated file and it makes no sense to modify it.  You
	  have to modify the source file called plugins/cscript/common/cs.i and
	  then run the target 'make cspythonswig' (provided you have swig).
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a bug in the WAL image loader where it was
	  unconditionally trying to access 100 bytes of the incoming image
	  even if the image contained fewer than 100 bytes, thus it was
	  potentially accessing memory beyond the end of the allocated block.
	  This would result in a crash on some platforms.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed several problems in mdl2spr where it was
	  accessing strings as though they were null-terminated even though it
	  had neither ensured null-termination nor even ensured that the
	  allocated buffer was large enough to hold the null-terminator.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a fundamental flaw in mdl2spr which completely
	  corrupted converted Quake 2 models.  The conversion process was
	  essentially throwing away valid vertex coordinates and substituting
	  incorrect coordinates in their stead.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated the very annoying behavior of csSimpleInput
	  where it would erase the console's input line when the user pressed
	  Return.  The result was that after pressing Return, the user could
	  not see what had been typed.  Now the input line is preserved.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a bug in csSimpleInput where it would corrupt
	  memory when Delete was pressed at the end of the input line.
	- Eric Sunshine changed the location of inclusion of `video/renderer' &
	  `video/canvas' in the PLUGINS variable.  These items used to be
	  specified in user.mak.  However, since they are not optional, it did
	  not make sense to place them in a user-configurable file.
	- Wouter Wijngaards added the following methods to the fire mesh API:
	  GetNumberParticles, GetDropSize, GetOrigin, GetDirection,
	  GetLighting, GetSwirl, GetColorScale and GetColorScale.
	- Wouter added FireFactorySaver and FireSaver plugins.
20-Mar-2001:
	- Philip Wyett altered his email address in the docs.
	- Wouter Wijngaards added the following methods to explosion
	  particlesystem: GetNumberParticles, GetCenter, GetPush, GetNrSides,
	  GetPartRadius, GetLighting, GetSpreadPos, GetSpreadSpeed,
	  GetSpreadAcceleration and GetFadeSprites.
	- Wouter also added a method GetColor() to iParticleState, to get the
	  particle color.
	- Wouter added the ExplosionSaver and ExplosionFactorySaver PlugIns.
	- Split rview.cpp and rview.h into rview and lview.  rview contains
	  csRenderView and lview contains everything related to the shadow
	  calculations.
	- Robert Bate brought the Mac projects files up to date.
	- Philip Wyett manually updated the VC project files.
	- Philip also did a fix to the python plugin.
18-Mar-2001
	- Fixed skydomes so that they need to be in the same part. Without
	  this fix the circle command could only correctly be specified in the
	  first part.
16-Mar-2001
	- Eric Sunshine renamed all of the pure SCF interface header files.
	  Considering that that these files were recently organized into
	  well-named subdirectories, it is possible to use more descriptive
	  names for the files themselves.  Also dropped the `i' prefix.  Here
	  are just a few examples of the new more meaningful and descriptive
	  names:
	    iengine/idlight.h  --> iengine/dynlight.h
	    iengine/imeshobj.h --> iengine/mesh.h
	    imesh/imeshobj.h   --> imesh/object.h
	    imesh/mfire.h      --> imesh/fire.h
	    imap/ildrplug.h    --> imap/reader.h
	    imap/isvrplg.h     --> imap/writer.h
	    isound/isnddrv.h   --> isound/driver.h
	    isound/isndlstn.h  --> isound/listener.h
	    ivideo/imater.h    --> ivideo/material.h
	- Fixed Python scripting after the changes from Eric.
15-Mar-2001
	- Let csShadowIterator implement iShadowIterator.
	- Let csShadowBlock implement iShadowBlock.
	- Let csShadowBlockList implement iShadowBlockList.
	- Philip Wyett fixed on exit errors under VC6 builds/Windows for
	  demosky.  Removed cleanup function from app and moved delete System;
	  to apps destructor.
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed a bug in the procedural sky - when you
	  stopped animation, different polygons could be out of synch.  Now all
	  skytextures of a procedural sky are set to a forced rerender for the
	  next time they become visible.
	- Wouter also got animated sky to work correctly.  SetAnimated(false,
	  ...) now takes a *lot* of time.  (like a second or so).  But during
	  this time all sky textures are brought up to date.  This makes the
	  sky look seamless, and you are guaranteed no more slowdowns.
14-Mar-2001
	- Fixed a bug in csRenderView.  IncRef() should be DecRef().  Thanks to
	  Norman Kramer for spotting this.
	- Philip Wyett changed Visual C++ service pack recommendation to 5.
	- Norman Kramer fixed the crashes that occured when farplanes were used
	  (overlooked the problem a few times before realizing whats going
	  on!).
13-Mar-2001
	- Philip Wyett fixed VC6 compile error in 'plgengine', created by move
	  of 'int ApplicationShow;'.  Modification was made to SCF interface to
	  allow correct usage of it and leaving Martins intention of being able
	  to create apps without 'cssys' intact.
	- Reverted part of the patch from Philip because otherwise OpenGL would
	  not open a window when running apps (if using MingW).
12-Mar-2001
	- Robert Bate updated the Mac project files and added project files for
	  terrain plugin.
	- Martin Geisse did a small update to the windows docs.
	- Martin also fixed a bug in the system driver.
	- Martin moved the 'ApplicationShow' variable from cssys to cswin32exe,
	  so you can create applications that don't use cssys.
	- Added a new constructor csFrustum with which you can create a frustum
	  that already has place for the right number of vertices but the
	  vertices are not initialized yet.
	- Added new csVector3 and csVector2 Set() routine that accepts another
	  csVector3 or csVector2 respectively.
	- Did more work on cleaning up the shadow frustum code in order to make
	  it easier to make it SCF interfaces.  For example, csShadowFrustum is
	  now completely private to the shadow block classes.
	- Eric Sunshine performed some rewriting of material recently added to
	  simple.txi.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated an `overfull hbox' warning reported by TeX
	  for tutorial/map2cs/step3.txi.
	- Eric Sunshine applied a patch to Squawk from Michael H. Voase
	  <mvoase@midcoast.com.au> which allows the camera to be moved forward
	  and backward.
11-Mar-2001
	- Norman Kramer renamed avi codec classnames from codec.*
	  to codec.avi.*.
	- Norman also removed iCodec interface and replaced it with
	  iAVICodec that lives in plugins/../format/avi.
	- Norman added entry for rel codec to the makefiles.
	- Norman added iAVICodec interface. csAVI now handles format-
	  extension.
	- Philip Wyett added new RLE plugin to workspace.
	- Philip also fixed a compile error in AVI plugin.
	- Wouter Wijngaards added cube factory saver and cubesaver plugins.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed some Texinfo mark-up problems in win32.txi.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed formatting of help message in rle.mak.
	- Eric Sunshine added DSP.DDG.CFLAGS to ddg.mak in order to augment the
	  generated DSP file with an appropriate "/I" directive.
	- Added interfaces iShadowBlock, iShadowBlockList, and iShadowIterator.
	  These will be used by the iShadowSystem. Extended iShadowSystem,
	  iShadowCaster, and iShadowReceiver a bit.
	- Changed the csShadowIterator a bit so that it will be easier
	  to let it implement iShadowReceiver. The basic idea is that
	  csShadowFrustum must become a private concept of the shadow
	  blocks and that only csFrustum is used.
	- Eric Sunshine applied patches to mdl2spr from Matt Keith
	  <keith@www.keithcom.com> which allow mdl2spr to generate sprite files
	  which conform to the new mesh plugin architecture.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed an error in the `motion-anim' rule in mapfmt.txi.
10-Mar-2001
	- Cleaned up layout in DDG loader and also made a small fix
	  in csTerrainWrapper constructor declaration.
	- Added interfaces iShadowSystem, iShadowCaster, and
	  iShadowReceiver. These new interfaces will be the basis for
	  a system to replace CheckFrustum.
9-Mar-2001
	- Fixed some include files in the Direct3D6.1 plugin which were
	  not converted to the new structure.
	- Wouter Wijngaards committed six textures to stdtex.zip, which
	  will be useful for making nice lens flares. They are:
	  flare_center.jpg flare_grcir.jpg flare_picir.jpg flare_pink.jpg
	  flare_purp.jpg flare_rbow.jpg.
	  These will look nice when added in different sizes, with mixmode
	  CS_FX_ADD.
	- Wouter also added a method to scf's iFactory: QueryClassID that
	  will return the class ID of the plugin from which the object
	  originates. Of course this will cause massive re-compilation,
	  but the header changes require compilation anyway.
	- Wouter also added to csutil/util.h the function csFindReplace,
	  that copies a string from source to dest, whilst find&replacing
	  substrings inside. It will also check destination buffer overflow.
	- Wouter started support for saving in the mesh loader plugins.
	- Wouter added access methods for Radius and Shift in iBallState.
	- Wouter implemented the ball factory and object savers.
	- Wouter fixed another halo bug (a line of garbage on the top side
	  of the halo).
	- Thomas Hieber separated the Loader from the actual data storage.
	  This will allow easy saving of modified data, and conversion to
	  other formats like binary formats.
	- Seth Galbraith fixed sprites in squawk to work with new
	  mesh object system. Sprites actions still don't work and
	  sprite smoothing is also broken.
8-Mar-2001
	- Eric Sunshine moved all of the pure SCF interface header files (the
	  filenames beginning with `i') into subdirectories of CS/include.
	  They no longer reside directly in CS/include.  The new subdirectories
	  within CS/include are iengine, igame, igeom, igraphic, imap, imesh,
	  inetwork, iobject, isound, isys, iterrain, iutil, ivaria, and ivideo.
	  Also, several files were decomposed into multiple new files, so you
	  may need to include one or more of the new files in place of the old
	  ones.  The files which were specially split are:
	    itexture.h -> iengine/itexture.h & ivideo/itexture.h
	    imater.h   -> iengine/imater.h   & ivideo/imater.h
	    imeshobj.h -> iengine/imeshobj.h & imesh/imeshobj.h
	    iterrobj.h -> iengine/iterrobj.h & iterrain/iterrobj.h
	  Also updated all source & header files, documentation files, and
	  makefiles to reflect this change.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated several compilation warnings throughout the
	  project.
	- Brandon Ehle did the following:
	  Mostly scripting updates, but also a modification to the common.mak
	  that enable multiprocessor compiles 'make -j5' etc
	    - Various fixes to the cs.i file concerning the lack of
	      iPolygonSet.
	    - Updated cspython swig interface.
	    - Fixed some cslua swig bugs, and added a default script
	      'pysimp.lua'.
	    - Added support to pysimp to run test code in python and in lua.
	- Thomas Hieber did the following changes:
	    - Added classes.xml which is a protype of a gameclass definition
	      XML file. He is going to use this file for testing in the
	      future, and also for reference on the file format. 
	      (until there is a real spec on it).
	    - Changed the interface of the XML file another time. 
	      I really like this change, because the code is more powerful
	      now, _and_ is simpler too.
	- Martin Geisse did the following:
	    - Removed the old iConfigFile interface.
	    - Renamed iConfigFileNew to iConfigFile.
	    - Renamed icfgnew.h to icfgfile.h.
	    - Removed many references to the old config system.
7-Mar-2001
	- Martin Geisse changed CSWS to use the new config system.
	- Thomas Hieber completely changed the way data from XML maps to
	  iDataLoader. The way it is done now will introduce far less
	  typing overhead, and looks nicer too.
	- Thomas Hieber did the following:
	  csString stores a NULL pointer if you set an empty string.
	  (This seems to be some optimisation) Now, it will return an empty
	  string in these cases, instead of a NULL pointer, when you ask
	  for the string.
	- Thomas fixed some potentially uninitialized variable.
	- csThing::MergeTemplate() now works through object space coordinates
	  all the time.
	- Fixed a bug in the new camera system. When the camera didn't update
	  then moving objects would not be refreshed correctly. The reason
	  is that the camera vertices were only updated when the camera
	  changes but they also need to be updated when the movable changes.
	- Added the terrain engine plugin from Richard D. Shank. This is
	  the same terrain engine we used to have all the time. But this
	  time it is implemented as a plugin. Great work Richard!
	  Note that the old terrlod is currently no longer supported.
	  Richard will do that one soon.
	- Fixed several bugs in the new terrain plugin.
	- 'make walkall' will now also compile the standard canvas that
	  belongs with the software renderer and the OS. The way this works
	  is that every such canvas which is for the software renderer
	  and which is default adds itself to 'softcanvas' target.
	  'make walkall' then depends on 'softcanvas' target as well.
	- Fixed a 'delete[]' vs 'delete' bug in md2 loader.
	- Eric Sunshine removed all remaining `csterr' library references from
	  the project.
	- Eric Sunshine added missing Texinfo mark-up to win32.txi.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated an "underfull hbox" warning from TeX in
	  config.txi.
	- Eric Sunshine changed the makefile system so that __CRYSTAL_SPACE__
	  is defined when building all files in the project.  (Previously, this
	  was only defined when building the DDG library.) This change had
	  already been applied to the Visual-C++ project files several months
	  ago.
	- Eric Sunshine resolved a problem with the new ddg.mak makefile were
	  CFLAGS.DDG was not being employed in all cases.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a potential #include problem in pol2d.h which was
	  reported by Navdeep S. Tinna <nst7@cs.columbia.edu>.
	- Eric Sunshine added `autoexec.cfg' to CFG.WALKTEST in walktest.mak.
	  This ensures that it will get installed with `make install'.
6-Mar-2001
	- Changed the following functions to work in object space instead
	  of world space:
	    - csPolygon3D::IntersectSegment()
	    - csPolygon3D::IntersectRay()
	    - csPolygon3D::IntersectRayNoBackFace()
	    - csPolygon3D::IntersectRayPlane()
	    - csPolygon3D::Overlaps()
	    - csPolygon3D::SetTextureSpace(...)
	    - csPolygon3D::PointOnPolygon()
	    - csPolyPlane::IntersectSegment()
	    - csThing::IntersectSphere()
	- Modified the csSector versions of IntersectSphere() and
	  IntersectSegment() to correctly use the movable of the things
	  if relevant to map world space to object space.
	- Further converted the following functions to work in object space
	  instead of world space:
	    - csPolygon3D::ClipFrustum()
	- Made some of the functions in csTransform virtual so that they
	  can be overriden by subclasses (i.e. csCamera in this case).
	- csCamera now has a number called 'cameranr' which is updated
	  whenever a new camera is created or a camera is updated. This
	  number can be used to check if an object transformed to camera
	  space is still valid. You can get this number with GetCameraNumber().
	- Also added iCamera::GetCameraNumber().
	- Removed csPolygon3D::ClipFrustum() and csPolygon3D::ClipPoly().
	- Removed csThing::GetCameraMinMaxZ().
	- Removed csThing::IntersectCameraZPlane().
	- Redesigned csThing and csPolygon3D camera vertex handling so that
	  they no longer go through the transformation manager. Instead they
	  use the camera number which is now defined in csCamera.
	- Consequently removed the transformation manager.
	- Fixed all mesh plugins that were using the transformation manager
	  (cube, ball, and spr3d). They are now using the camera number
	  instead.
	- Fixed a bug in csThing::MergeTemplate(). The function would not
	  copy the new moving flag from the template thing to the new instance.
	- Eric Sunshine repaired the csgamtst.mak makefile.  Apparently it
	  was just a verbatim copy of the pysimple makefile.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the gamecore makefile so that the plugin no
	  longer links with csEngine or any of its supporting libraries.
	- Eric Sunshine repaired numerous compilation problems in the gamecore
	  plugin.  Unfortunately, there is still one problem with the
	  DECLARE_SCF_STRINGMAP() macro where the compiler complains that it is
	  derived from a `private' csVector.  I have not yet looked closely at
	  this problem.  It is possible that it is specific to the NextStep
	  compiler.
	- Eric Sunshine removed a bunch of #include directives from gstd.h
	  which were importing csengine, csparser, csfx, csgfxldr, and cssys
	  headers.  Plugins should only interact with the system via SCF
	  interfaces, so it was incorrect to include these headers.
	- Thomas Hieber added a new class for XML loader.
	- Thomas also updated vfs.cfg with a path to csgam data.
	- Martin Geisse fixed a compilation problem in the linex canvas.
5-Mar-2001
	- Thomas Hieber did the following to the gamecore plugin:
	    - Added to scf.cfg.
	    - Added test application (csgamtst) for the plugin (not working
	      yet).
	    - Some minor adjustments to make the plugin loadable.
	    - Added project file for gamecore test application.
	    - Work on the gamecore plugin itself.
	- Removed the old and obsolete pvs code. It wasn't working anyway
	  and when I revive it I'm going to totally rewrite it.
	- Also removed a lot of functions that were only used by PVS.
	  I still kept a copy and they are also in CVS attic if it turns
	  out they were useful after all.
	- Changed several of the routines in csPolygon3D to operate on
	  object space coordinates instead of world space. This it make
	  it easier to make the world space coordinate array optional.
	- Eric Sunshine applied an obvious optimization to efed.pl.  It no
	  longer bothers reading the content of each file if the user only
	  requested file-rename operations (that is, no content-edit
	  operations).
	- Jorrit, further removed some references to world space vertices
	  from csPolygon3D.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a compilation warning from system.cpp
	  regarding unused `cfgacc' variable.
	- Eric Sunshine reworked the shared vertex pools in vtpool.h and
	  vtpool.cpp to be more NextStep compiler friendly.  The compiler was
	  looping infinitely when trying to compile vtpool.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine removed flarge.zip from the CVS repository and added
	  its plain text `world' file instead.  vfs.cfg was then adjusted so
	  that the `world' file is read from the real filesystem, whereas all
	  of the transient lightmap and visibility information is still cached
	  on the virtual filesystem within flarge.zip (which is _not_ part of
	  the CVS repository).  This change should prevent people from
	  committing transient binary data to the repository.  It also makes
	  better use of CVS, since the `world' file is plain text, which is
	  what CVS does best.
4-Mar-2001
	- Finalized the first rewrite of the data structures that are used
	  in CheckFrustum. A further rewrite and conversion to SCF will
	  follow in the near future.
	- Added support for HardTransform() to curved surfaces but it doesn't
	  work yet. The curve in flarge is thus currently not looking very
	  well.
	- Martin Geisse did another small optimization to the config manager.
3-Mar-2001
	- Martin Geisse added a speed optimization to the config manager.
	  If the same config file is used several times, it is now only
	  loaded once and IncRef'ed every time.
2-Mar-2001
	- Martin Geisse added a new domain in the configuration hierarchy
	  that can be used for user-specific configuration on multi-user
	  systems. Martin also added documentation for the user config
	  domain.
1-Mar-2001
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a compilation error which was recently introduced
	  into NeXTSystemDriver.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a bug in NeXTSystemDriver where it was
	  incorrectly requesting next.cfg from a physical volume rather than a
	  VFS volume.
	- Brandon Ehle added modifications for Lua scripting language:
	  The SWIGLua modifications were fairly easy, so here's the "goop."
	  Everything, SHOULD work now.  I don't know much about LUA, but it
	  appears to Query the system driver just fine and use it to make
	  function calls.
	- Martin Geisse did the following changes:
	    - Moved the default graphics configuration to video.cfg.
	    - Added iSystem::RemoveConfig to remove config files from the
	      config manager.
	    - Fixed a wrong header protector in cfgacc.h.
	    - Restructured csConfigFile a bit to make overloading the
	      core Load() and Save() methods easier.
	    - Added csPrefixConfig. This works like csConfigFile, except
	      that it only works with those keys in a config file that
	      begin with a certain substring, and leaves the other keys
	      untouched.
	    - Changed most modules to correctly remove any added config
	      files (using the csConfigAccess class).
	    - Changed the system driver to remove its private config file
	      as well.
	- Robert Bate did some work setting up the TARGET_API_* flags.
	- Robert removed the quit and the seperator from the file menu if
	  running on OSX.
	- Robert renamed timing.cpp to avoid name collision.
	- Robert did some updates on the Mac project files.
27-Feb-2001
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated numerous mark-up (and other) errors which
	  were reported by Doxygen throughout the headers.
	- Brandon Ehle checked in PS2 specific port stuff.
	  Everything works excepts lightmaps, only you need a couple of
	  external libraries that will be available soon.
	- Norman Kramer did the following change: when determining the
	  crystal dir it now looks up the scf.cfg instead of vfs.cfg.
	  Before this you could run an app w/o the CRYSTAL var set and no
	  vfs.cfg around.
	- Norman Kramer: now additional codec initdata chunks and stream
	  naming chunks are recognized (strd and strn).
	- Paul Garceau added flarge.zip and stdtex.zip to CVS.
26-Feb-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed the procedural texture blending mode
	  bug where procedural textures would corrupt the blending table
	  used for alpha blending (only for software rendering).
	- Fixed Simple for the latest thing changes (SetMovingOption()).
	- Fixed Blocks for the latest thing changes.
	- Fixed PtLab for the latest thing changes.
	- Fixed 'portal' command in WalkTest for latest thing changes.
	- Added new version of csPooledVertexArrayPool.
	- Changed csFrustum so that it will now use a pool to allocate
	  vertex arrays. Which pool is used depends on the frustum user.
	  By default it will now use the default pool which means that
	  vertex arrays are still allocated with new[] and delete[].
	- Continued work on a new CheckFrustum.
	- Philip Wyett added EAX 2.0 plugin for Windows developed by
	  Nathaniel Saint Martin. This plugin will require for
	  compilation the Creative Labs EAX 2.0 SDK from either Creative
	  Labs website or you can obtain a cut down version from:
		http://noote.multimania.com/CrystalSpace/sdk/eax20.zip
	- Eric Sunshine moved specification of the special EAX sound libraries
	  from mk/msvcgen/plugin.tpl to sndeax.mak.
	- Eric Sunshine added extra clarification to the various discussions of
	  scfreg to further indicate that its use is entirely optional.
25-Feb-2001
	- Added csVertexArrayPool, csPooledVertexArrayPool, and
	  csDefaultVertexArrayPool. These will be used for pooled
	  vertex arrays.
	- Renamed csPooledVertexArrayPool to csStackedVertexArrayPool.
	- Started work on a completely redesigned CheckFrustum routine.
	  I will start by making it a seperate function first and mark
	  every thing I have to modify with FRUSTNEW. If all works well
	  I can later remove the old routines.
	- Wouter Wijngaards did the following:
	    - Touched up the flare a little.
	    - Removed the second engine::Prepare call, it is no longer
	      needed. This also makes the flare work in 8 bit mode -
	      try simple -sdepth=8 16 and 32 bit are still dark though.
	    - Sized the flare in simple to more modest (non-debugging)
	      proportions.
	    - Fixed a bug in the halo drawing code of the software
	      renderer. Due to Qrounding the scan could go on for one more
	      line, below the actual height of the halo. I changed those
	      relevant QRound calls to QInt, in order to round down. This
	      skips this line, preventing the appearance of a line with
	      small random dots below a halo.
	- Norman Kramer added support for index list (this solves the
	  weird pictures in ToolSober.avi).
24-Feb-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards did the following:
	    - Enabled the existing halos to fade out. This was disabled.
	      Not sure if this was intentional. Seems to work fine in
	      software/opengl.
	    - Added a 'flare' halo. This type of halo is a lensflare.
	      You can design your own flares, stateing pixmaps and mixmodes.
	      Added classes csFlareHalo, csLightFlareHalo to deal with this.
	      Added support in the engine for the FlareHalo.
	    - Added a 2 halos and a lensflare to simple.
	      The lensflare works fine in opengl, but software mode not
	      seem to work right (the pictures look wrong, it is a 'black'
	      flare).
	- Philip Wyett removed very restrictive code which forces
	  DIRECTINPUT_VERSION to 0x0300 and replaced it with test statement
	  block which uses WINVER to set DIRECTINPUT_VERSION.
	    - For Win 98/SE/ME/2000 or above DIRECTINPUT_VERSION is set to
  	      0x0800. Don't worry if your using a lower DX SDK as any
	      DX SDK 5 or above in <dinput.h> uses the '#if
	      DIRECTINPUT_VERSION >=' thus makes this method totally
	      backward compatible.
	    - For Win95 and NT4. DIRECTINPUT_VERSION is set to 0x0300 as
	      it's the highest NT4 supports and you cannot seperate NT4
	      and 95 by version so have to be set to the same value.
	  Have tested on most flavors of Windows and both VC and MingW...
	- Norman Kramer added dummy audio stream and did further work on AVI.
23-Feb-2001
	- Started work on a big change to the way that things control movement.
	  The CS_ENTITY_MOVEABLE flag is gone.  Instead there are now three
	  options.  But they don't work yet.
	- Added csThing::SetMovingOption()/GetMovingOption().
	- Added csThing::WorUpdate().
	- Wouter Wijngaards did the following improvements to demosky:
	    - Fixed procedural sky and demosky. You can now control the
	      animated better. You can stop the animation whenever you
	      like, and later on, have it continue either where it would
	      have been if it had been running, or where it would was when
	      you stopped the animation. Demosky resumes where it left off.
	    - Added a flock of seagulls to demosky. They fly around the
	      center. Added seagull texture to standard.zip (6.5Kb).
	    - Fixes crash at exit.
	- Robert Bate moved some files from libs/cssys/mac.
	- Robert also enhanced carbon compatibility for the Mac port.
22-Feb-2001
	- Martin Geisse added iConfigManager::SetDynamicDomain().
	- Wouter Wijngaards made clouds blow across the sky by a
	  configurable wind (direction/speed) when animated in demosky.
	- Robert Bate updated the Macintosh port.
	- Robert started work to Carbonize the Mac port.
	- Robert added CSPro6 compatibility to the Mac port.
	- Philip Wyett removed: 'System.Win32.DebugConsole = yes/no'
	  from system.cfg and re-coded 'SetSystemDefaults' so if you do a
	  debug build you get the debug console windows and if you do a
	  release build you do not. This is prep work for a Win32 fix to
	  come and new DX8 drivers.
	- Added iPolygon3D::GetWorldPlane(), GetObjectPlane(),
	  GetCameraPlane(), GetPortal(), and IsTransparent().
	- Added const versions of csPolyPlane::GetCameraPlane() and
	  GetObjectPlane().
	- Replaced iPortal::SetFlags() with GetFlags() :-)
	- Added iCamera::GetSector().
	- Replaced all csXxx fiels in csRenderView with iXxx fields (if
	  applicable).
	- Added iEngine::GetTopLevelClipper().
	- csRenderView no longer inherits from csCamera. I added
	  csRenderContext which contains all the fields that can change
	  from one recursion level to another. So the iRenderView
	  interface has changed a lot (check it out).
	- Fixed CS_ENTITY_CAMERA flag for things. It is even slightly more
	  efficient than it was before.
	- Merged csDetailedPolyTreeObject into csPolyTreeBBox.
	- Merged csPolyTreeObject into csPolyTreeBBox.
	- Merged csObjectStub with csPolygonStub.
	- Merged csObjectStubFactory with csPolygonStubFactory.
	- Renamed csObjectStubPool to csPolygonStubPool.
21-Feb-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards made animation of procedural sky work. The
	  clouds move and change when you animate the sky.
	- Added iMeshObject::GetShapeNumber(). Using this number one can
	  check if the object has changed shape enough so that the maximum
	  bounding box is no longer valid. All mesh object plugins implement
	  this function now.
	- Added a similar iMovable/csMovable::GetUpdateNumber() which serves
	  the same function but is updated when the object moves (i.e.
	  in movable.UpdateMove()).
	- Extended iVisibilityObject with GetShapeNumber(). Implementations
	  should call GetShapeNumber() on the underlying object.
	- csThing no longer implements iMovableListener. I reimplemented this
	  using the GetShapeNumber() and GetUpdateNumber() above.
	- csThing now implements iMeshObject. The implementation is not
	  yet working though.
	- csThing now implements iMeshObjectFactory.
	- Extended iRenderView with AddedFogInfo(), GetThisSector(),
	  GetPreviousSector(), GetFrustum(), and SetFrustum().
	- Extended iSector with GetID() and HasFog().
	- Extended iCamera with GetFarPlane() and SetMirrored().
	- Added csPoly2D::ClipAgainst() which accepts iClipper2D instead
	  of csClipper.
	- Added iClipper2D::ClipInPlace().
	- Added iEngine::IsPVS().
	- Fully changed csThing so that it now uses iRenderView instead
	  of csRenderView. This will help to move to a plugin later.
	- Added new constructor to csPlaneClip which accepts a csPlane3.
	- Changed csCurve::GetScreenBoundingBox() to use iCamera instead
	  of csCamera.
	- Note that these changes break CAMERA things and reflecting
	  portals. Not sure why yet.
	- Reflecting portals work again. The bug was very nasty. You
	  have to be very careful when defining copy constructors (or
	  forgetting to define them) for classes implementing SCF interfaces.
	  If you are not careful scfParent is simply copied and you get
	  bad and unexpected results of scfParent still pointing to the
	  original class. Even worse is when you have classes that inherit
	  from classes that implement SCF interfaces. This was the case
	  with csRenderView. As an unexpected bonus this fix also fixes
	  the problem that sprites and particle systems were not visible
	  in mirrors.
	- Removed csSphere... classes related to polygon tree visibility.
	  They were not used and would have to be redone anyway in order
	  to be useful.
	- Eric Sunshine resolved a circular reference problem between the
	  system driver and the VFS plugin.  The actual problem was that the
	  VFS plugin was utilizing the new configuration manager module even
	  though it should not have been doing so.  There are a couple of
	  reasons why utilization of the configuration manager by VFS was
	  problematic.  First, this introduced an unwanted circularity since
	  the configuration manager and the VFS plugin each relied upon the
	  services of the other.  Second, it does not make sense for the VFS
	  plugin to utilize the configuration manager at initialization time
	  since the VFS plugin is loaded very early in the application start-up
	  sequence.  In fact, it is loaded before any other configuration files
	  have been loaded (indeed, all other configuration files are typically
	  loaded from a VFS volume; thus this was a chicken-and-egg issue).
	  Now the VFS plugin manually loads its own configuration file
	  (vfs.cfg) rather than relying on the configuration manager mechanism.
	  In the future, we should introduce some new API into the VFS plugin
	  which allows an application to override or augment the initial
	  configuration from vfs.cfg.  This will allow a client application to
	  provide its own VFS.Mount settings if desired.  Also note that when
	  this API is finally added it should be in the form of a method in the
	  VFS plugin which is invoked by the client application (or system
	  driver) and that method should accept an iConfigFile* as its
	  argument.  The VFS plugin can then query this configuration object
	  for the desired information.  There is no need to re-introduce any
	  circularity with iConfigManager.
	- Eric Sunshine converted several modules to use the new configuration
	  manager which were missed by Martin when he made his conversion sweep
	  through the project.
	- Eric Sunshine modified all makefiles project-wide so that the
	  individual `clean' targets (such as `softclean', `x2dclean', etc.) no
	  longer remove the dependency information (.dep files).  In theory,
	  having a module's `clean' target remove the .dep file was a sensible
	  idea, however in actual practice, it turned out to be quite obnoxious
	  to lose dependency information each time an individual module's
	  `clean' target was invoked.  You can still remove dependency files by
	  invoking one of the standard and existing targets `cleandep' or
	  `distclean'.
	- Eric Sunshine renamed WalkTest's configuration file from cryst.cfg to
	  walktest.cfg.  Updated all documentation, source code, and other
	  references to reflect this change.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a couple `hbox' warnings reported by TeX for
	  the Texinfo documentation.
20-Feb-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards applied fix to demosky as suggested by Seth
	  Galbraith. This fixed the crackes in the skydome. It aligns
	  perfectly now.
	- Wouter also did a big speed improvement in procedural sky.
	  Demosky is friendlier now, displaying a help line, and you can
	  toggle the sky animation/recalculation. Procedural sky is faster,
	  since the scaling is now done in advance, perhaps the quality
	  improved too.
	- Martin Geisse moved system driver specific configuration to
	  system.cfg (except the list of plug-in modules); moved simple
	  console specific configuration to simpcon.cfg.
	- Martin changed the following in the config system:
	    - Plugins using a private config file now use the config manager.
	    - Renamed iSystem::CreateConfig to iSystem::CreateINIConfig.
	    - Renamed iSystem::CreateConfigNew to
	      iSystem::CreateSeparateConfig.
	- Martin also moved engine-specific config keys to
	  CS/data/config/engine.cfg.
	- Martin added documentation for the config manager system.
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed config call in OpenGL x2d canvas.
	- Philip Wyett did a small fix to the Map2CS tutorial.
	- Norman Kramer cleaned up the unresolved instances for meshes,
	  loaders and factories.
	- Norman switched the X11 canvases to iConfigManager.
	- Norman added a destructor to csRenderView so that there are no
	  memory engine.core leaks.
	- Eric Sunshine resolved several compilation problems on MacOS/X which
	  were reported in a series of build-logs sent by Travis McLane
	  <tmclane@swt.edu>.
	    - Several AppKit and Foundation headers needed to be imported into
	      various source files.  In the past, these headers got pulled in
	      by other system headers which were already being imported, but
	      this is no longer the case as of MacOS/X.
	    - NSDPSContext was replaced by NSGraphicsContext.  The code now
	      conditionally references the correct class depending upon
	      platform.  Also centralized the graphics context flushing
	      mechanism into NeXTDelegate.m since it is needed from a couple
	      different places.  Added a new extension to
	      NeXTSystemDriver::SystemExtension() named "flushgraphicscontext".
	- Added useful defaults for some of the fields of the explosion plugin
	  so that it doesn't crash when those fields are not set.
	- Moved 'initialized' flag from specific particle systems to the
	  general particle system code. If a material is now set initialized
	  will be reset to false so that the particle system is reinitialized.
	- Changed the way that iMeshObject::GetObjectBoundingBox() works.
	  Instead of the 'accurate' flag there is now a 'type' flag which
	  has three possible values:
	    - CS_BBOX_NORMAL: get a normal bounding box which
	      may or may not be recalculated depending on the changing
	      geometry of the object.
	    - CS_BBOX_ACCURATE: get a totally accurate bounding
	      box. Not all plugins support this. Some will just return
	      a normal bounding box.
	    - CS_BBOX_MAX: get the maximum bounding box
	      that this object will ever use. For objects that don't have a
	      preset maximum bounding box this just has to be a reasonable
	      estimate of a realistic maximum bounding box.
	- Modified all mesh object plugins for this change.
	- Changed csMeshWrapper so that the GetObjectBox() function in
	  the iVisibilityObject implementation returns the CS_BBOX_MAX
	  bounding box from the mesh.
	- Added a 'meshes' target to the makefile to compile all mesh
	  object and loader plugins at once.
	- The changes above 'fix' the particle systems from being invisible
	  when used with the visibility culler but the fix is far from
	  perfect. This needs a small design change.
	- Cleaned up sector.h and removed some of the obsolete fields.
	- Removed sector argument from csSector::Prepare().
19-Feb-2001
	- Norman Kramer changed all csSector::GetNumberXxx() to GetNumXxx().
	- Martin Geisse modified the system driver to use the config
	  manager as its main config object. Currently the manager uses
	  the application config as its dynamic config, but no other
	  config files. So this modification should not change any behaviour.
	- Wouter Wijngaards changed procedural sky so that it can now run
	  in a special non-animated mode. With this setting demosky is
	  now a LOT faster.
	- Fixed a bug in csMeshWrapper::SetMeshObject().
	- Fixed a bug in csMovable. The parent reference should not
	  be incref'ed/decref'ed as that creates a circular reference.
	- Fixed a bug in the handling of iMovable by csMeshWrapper. This
	  caused simple to crash at exit.
	- Fixed an additional bug in simple which would cause another
	  crash at exit.
	- Fixed a bug in WalkTest. If you pressed the mouse button WalkTest
	  would just continue going forward even after releasing it again.
	  Bug fixed by Navdeep S. Tinna.
	- Added iMovableListener interface instead of the
	  csMovableListener callback function.
	- csThing now implements iMovableListener.
	- Added GetEngineMode() to iEngine.
	- Added GetVisibilityCuller() to csSector and iSector.
	- csThing and csMeshWrapper now implement iVisibilityObject.
	- Made all the object vectors in csSector private and added
	  accessor functions to add or remove objects from them. The
	  reason for this is that the sector may want to do extra processing
	  on the objects (like registering them to the culler for example).
	  These are the accessor functions that are added:
	      - AddMesh, UnlinkMesh, GetNumberMeshes, GetMesh(1), GetMesh(2).
	      - AddThing, UnlinkThing, GetNumberThing, GetThing(1)
	      - AddSky, UnlinkSky, GetNumberSkies, GetSky(1)
	      - AddCollection, UnlinkCollection, GetNumberCollections,
	      	GetCollection(1), GetCollection(2).
	      - UnlinkLight, GetNumberLights, GetLight(1), GetLight(2).
	      - AddTerrain, UnlinkTerrain, GetNumberTerrains,
	        GetTerrain(1), GetTerrain(2).
	- Fixed all the CS apps to work with the above functions.
	- Optimized csMovable::SetSector() so that it does not do anything
	  if the object is already in that sector.
	- Removed 'owner' from csPolyTreeObject since it is actually not
	  used and we will not be able to give it anyway with the new
	  system.
	- Removed the csPolyTreeObject's from csThing and csMeshWrapper.
	  This is now the responsibility of the visibility culler.
	- Continued working on the visibility plugin system. It is now
	  working mostly. The next step will be to really seperate it
	  more cleanly from the engine. Note that there are still bugs
	  in the vis system. It sometimes says something is invisible
	  when it is visible.
	- Fixed crasher in phyztest.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated several compilation warnings from MSVC
	  (reported by Martin Geisse) in sft3dcom.cpp and avistrv.cpp about
	  variables possibly used uninitialized.
	- Cleaned up the csThing.h header a lot. Made a lot private
	  and added GetCurvesScale/SetCurvesScale and GetCurvesCenter/
	  SetCurvesCenter.
	- Eric Sunshine performed a major update to the Apple/NeXT
	  documentation in the user's manual.
	    - Overhauled to reflect all the recent major work done to the
	      Apple/NeXT ports.
	    - Now mentions new (untested) MacOS/X port.
	    - Added and updated resource URLs.
	    - Reworked port-specific file-description section.  Now takes into
	      account recent distillation of Objective-C++ into pure C++ and
	      pure Objective-C.
	    - Discusses new CrystalSpaceRoot and CrystalSpaceRootIgnore
	      defaults.
	    - Added key-mapping discussion for NextStep.
	    - Added several new To-Do and Bugs items to the `NeXT Notes'
	      section.
	    - Many other clarifications and enhancements.
	- Eric Sunshine updated the BeOS-specific documentation in the user's
	  manual.
	- Eric Sunshine repaired a significant number of TeX formatting
	  problems which were recently introduced into the Texinfo source
	  files.
	- Eric Sunshine converted several of the map2cs tutorial EPS images
	  back to gray scale so that they will look nicer in typical printed
	  output.  They also display correctly once again on NeXT.
18-Feb-2001
	- Martin Geisse added some missing 'volatile' keywords to the
	  waveout driver.
	- Renamed csPolygonSetBBox to csThingBBox.
	- Moved the octree from csSector to csThing. Added
	  csThing::BuildStaticTree() to create this tree.
	- Changed the implementation of csSector::UseStaticTree() so that
	  it will now call BuildStaticTree() for all things having the
	  CS_ENTITY_VISTREE flag set. At this moment only one such thing
	  will be properly handled by csSector (at least what visibility
	  is concerned). In the past the octree was built for all things
	  which were then merged into one big thing. Now the tree is
	  built on one thing alone.
	- Added new CS_ENTITY_VISTREE flag for csThing which means this
	  thing will get an octree. Removed CS_ENTITY_NOBSP flag which is
	  no longer useful now. Added 'VISTREE' flag for loader and
	  removed 'NOBSP' flag.
	- csPolygonTree (octree and bsp trees) are now attached to a csThing
	  instead of a csSector.
	- Removed support for 'BSP', 'LIGHTX', 'ACTIVATE', 'TRIGGER',
	  and 'MAX_TEXTURES' statements in the loader. These have been
	  obsolete for a long time.
	- Added support for parts in things. In the loader it is now possible
	  to define a thing which contains parts. This is mainly
	  useful for the representation of the static thing as you can
	  then still maintain a logical division of the static thing into
	  seperate sub-things. Note that at this moment the engine doesn't
	  keep track of the logical units. It is simply the loader that
	  allows this syntax. A 'PART' is completely similar to a THING
	  except that it can only occur as part of another THING or PART
	  and that it has no engine representation (at the moment). All
	  part's in a thing are simply merged.
	- Updated all CS apps to work with all the recent changes.
	- csThing is now responsible for drawing its own static tree if
	  it has one.
	- Started work on iVisibilityCuller and iVisibilityObject. Using these
	  two SCF interfaces it will be possible to seperate visibility
	  culling logically and physically from the engine itself.
	  Objects that implement iVisibilityCuller know how to test visibility
	  for objects. The visibility culler will work with objects that
	  implement iVisibilityObject. This will eventually make it
	  possible to plug in other visibility systems into CS without
	  changing the engine. This system is not yet working.
	- Extended iMovable and csMovable with a list of movement listeners.
	  A movement listener is some other object that is interested
	  in hearing whenever the movable changes (i.e. the object moves).
	  This will be used for visibility testing. The visibility culler
	  will add itself as a listener to the movable of the objects it
	  wants to test.
18-Feb-2001
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a compilation warning in levtool.cpp on
	  BeOS.
	- Eric Sunshine finished the conversion of the Glide 3D driver to the
	  new configuration file system.  This conversion had been started by
	  someone else previously, but was incomplete.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed g2dtest.cpp so that it now explicitly closes the
	  iGraphics2D context which it creates (much like the 3D context is
	  explicitly closed by 3D applications).
	- Eric Sunshine began updating the documentation for the Apple/NeXT
	  port:
	    - Mentions new (untested) MacOS/X port.
	    - Major changes in code and file organization.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a problem on MacOS/X Server 1.0 (Rhapsody) where
	  a system header was defining a macro named Free().  Unfortunately,
	  this macro was conflicting with several Crystal Space classes which
	  have methods named Free().  This problem only manifested when certain
	  facilities were requested via the SYSDEF_* macros and <libc.h> was
	  imported.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the default setting of INSTALL_DIR in install.mak
	  so that it now works correctly with the GNU make shipped with
	  MacOS/X Server 1.0 (Rhapsody).
	- Eric Sunshine changed next/csosdefs.h so that it only fakes up the
	  strdup() function on OpenStep and NextStep.  It is no longer faked
	  up for MacOS/X or MacOS/X Server 1.0 (Rhapsody).
	- Eric Sunshine worked around a bug in the OpenStep compiler which was
	  triggered by cfgmgr.cpp.  The problem is that the compiler creates
	  unlinkable code when an inline method invokes a second inline method
	  which the compiler has not yet seen.
	- Eric Sunshine added an ugly (and hopefully temporary) OpenStep/Sparc
	  hack to pol2d.cpp to work around "local relocation entries in
	  non-writable section" linkage errors.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed several Texinfo mark-up errors in the User's
	  Manual.
17-Feb-2001
	- csSector is now properly seperated from csPolygonSet. Sectors
	  no longer contain polygons.
	- Added csEngine::CreateSectorWalls() which is a conveniance
	  function that will create the thing which is supposed to
	  contain the convex outline of the sector. This function is added
	  to make it easier to convert old code that adds polygons to the
	  sector to new code where the same polygons are added to the
	  'outline thing'.
	- Added iSector and csSector::CalculateSectorBBox() to calculate the
	  bounding box of all objects in a sector (mesh objects and things
	  currently).
	- Rain and snow console commands in WalkTest now use
	  CalculateSectorBBox() to calculate the bounding box for the
	  particle system.
	- Moved support for SKYDOME command in csloader to the thing
	  loader instead of the sector loader.
	- Removed iPolygonSet and put all functionality in iThing.
	- Removed all the Dumper::Memory() functions. They were incorrect,
	  difficult to maintain and almost impossible to correctly implement
	  with all the geometry moving to plugins.
	- Removed the class csPolygonSet and moved all functionality to
	  csThing.
	- Eric Sunshine defined the missing DESCRIPTION.OS.beos variable in
	  lib/cssys/beos/beos.mak.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a compilation error in cfgfile.cpp on BeOS.
	- Martin Geisse fixed a bug in the pysimp application.
	- Martin also removed two unused options from cryst.cfg.
	- Martin changed the VFS documentation to deal with the new
	  config format.
	- Norman Kramer changed the test for NASM slightly. Also removed
	  writing of entry NASM=nasm.
16-Feb-2001
	- Dynamic lights do not traverse through mirroring portals anymore.
	  This caused a bug because the dynamic lighting routine can't handle
	  this correctly. Rather than fixing this routine (which would make
	  it slower) I choose to just disable this feature.
	- The dynamic lighting routine also accounts for space warping
	  portals now.
	- Added new flags for things: CS_ENTITY_ZFILL to use Z-fill instead
	  of Z-buffer for rendering, CS_ENTITY_INVISIBLE to not render at
	  all, CS_ENTITY_NOSHADOWS for not casting shadows,
	  CS_ENTITY_NOLIGHTING to disable lighting, CS_ENTITY_NOBSP
	  to exclude this object from bsp or octrees, and CS_ENTITY_BACK2FRONT
	  to render this object back to front (together with objects in
	  the same render order queue).
	- Removed 'use_z_buf' parameter to csThing::Draw(). This is now
	  controlled with the CS_ENTITY_ZFILL flag.
	- Sky objects automatically get the CS_ENTITY_ZFILL flag.
	- Added support in the thing loader for the flags INVISIBLE, ZFILL,
	  NOSHADOWS, NOLIGHTING, NOBSP, and BACK2FRONT.
	- Added 'shadow_thing_mask' and 'shadow_thing_value' to csFrustumView.
	  Every thing that is processed will be tested against this flag.
	  If it matches it will be used for shadow generation. Otherwise
	  not. The lighting routines will set these values so that
	  only things which have CS_ENTITY_NOSHADOWS NOT set will generate
	  shadows. This is for csSector::CheckFrustum().
	- Added 'process_thing_mask' and 'process_thing_value' to
	  csFrustumView. Every thing that is processed will be tested
	  against this flag. If it matches CheckFrustum() will recursively
	  call itself for this thing too. The lighting routines will set
	  these values so that only things which have CS_ENTITY_NOLIGHTING
	  NOT set will be further processed.
	- Removed a lot of the obsolete tokens in csparser.
	- Fixed a bug in csThing::MergeTemplate(). The function did not
	  correctly copy the flags from the template to the thing.
	- Started a VERY fundamental change in the engine. The sector will
	  no longer inherit from csPolygonSet and will thus no longer be
	  able to hold polygons. A sector is simply a container of objects.
	  The outer walls of a sector can be created using a thing object.
	- Finally removed the very old and ugly obsolete ROOM and SIXFACE
	  statements from the loader. Old levels will no longer be supported.
	- Fixed a bug in simple.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a couple of problems in
	  ddgTriangle3::intersectPointTriangle() which were reported by
	  Jonathon Doran <jon.doran@nsc.com>:
	    - The `d23' vector was being incorrectly computed.
	    - The Borland compiler was not able to grok computation of the
	      `d1', `d2', and `d3' vectors on account of very questionable
	      mixing of references and pointers.
15-Feb-2001
	- Updated various parts of the documentation. The most important
	  change is that the simple tutorial has been updated to the mesh
	  object plugin system.
	- Martin Geisse updated the documentation to deal with the new
	  config system. Martin also added some hints from Paulo Candido
	  to the win32 docs.
	- Fixed an old bug in the OpenGL canvas. The ScreenShot() function
	  did not work correctly on big-endian systems in 32-bit display
	  mode. The colors were wrong.
	- Fixed a bug in csMaterialHandle::FreeMaterial(). It would
	  accidently clean up the texture as well.
	- Fixed another bug in csMaterialHandle::Prepare(). This function
	  will now look if the material is still there and copy the
	  data again. This is useful to change material settings later.
	- Fixed a bug in csMaterialWrapper::Visit(). It would call
	  visit on the texture even if there is no texture for the material.
	  This naturally caused a crash.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated several compilation warnings in cfgmgr.h
	  and cfgmgr.h.
14-Feb-2001
	- Continued making use of QUERY_INTERFACE in the engine more sensible.
	  This involves:
	    - csMovable::SetParent()
	    - csMeshWrapper::Draw()
	    - csMeshWrapper::GetMovable()
	    - csPolyTexture::GetPolygon()
	    - csOctree::Cache()
	- Also did the same for all mesh object plugins and loaders, csparser
	  library, and csclear library.
	- Added csEngine::current_iengine which is a reference to the main
	  iEngine.
	- Fixed a bug in csMeshFactoryWrapper::SetMeshObjectFactory().  This
	  function would not correctly call DecRef() on the old factory and
	  IncRef() on the new one.
	- Renamed csEngine::meshobj_factories to csEngine::mesh_factories.
	- Changed all UpdateLighting routines everywhere to work directly with
	  iLight instead of csLight pointers.  That is easier and also avoids
	  some problems with the need to conver them.  This also fixes
	  iMeshWrapper::UpdateLighting().
	- csEngine::GetNearbyLights() now returns references to iLight instead
	  of csLight.
	- Fixed a few bugs in the explosion loader which prevented that loader
	  from working correctly.
	- Fixed a reference to zlib-win32-bin in the documentation.
	- Added full documentation for all the existing mesh object plugins in
	  CS.
	- Cleaned up mapfmt.txi documentation.  i.e.  removed all the
	  documentation related to sprite and particle systems.  This is now
	  documented with the mesh object plugin documentation.  Also added
	  documentation about MESHOBJ keyword.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes:
	    - Modified static.mak so that cslibref.cpp now depends upon the
	      system makefile (such as linux.mak) in addition to user.mak and
	      config.mak (upon which it historically depended).  This new
	      dependency catches the cases where the user modifies the PLUGINS
	      variable in the system makefile.
	    - Fixed a couple minor problems with ddraw.mak and fountain.mak so
	      that they work correctly with static linking.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to snapshot.py, the CVS
	  snapshot generation script.
	    - Improved error reporting when external (shell invoked) commands
	      fail.  The actual command is now reported (in addition to the
	      error message which has always been reported).
	    - Added the missing `-P' flag to the `cvs checkout' command.
	- Martin Geisse added a "Sound System Changes" section to apimod18.txi.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the user's manual:
	    - Fixed a significant number of Texinfo errors and warnings which
	      were recently introduced.
	    - Normalized a lot of Texinfo mark-up usage.
	    - Eliminated all overfull and underfull hbox warnings reported by
	      TeX.
13-Feb-2001
	- Philip Wyett did some proof reading of the docs:
	    - Added two missing web links for required mingw
	      external dll's jpeg and png.
	    - Grammar changes and added links.
	    - Expanded MSVC version requirements for CS compilation (i.e.
	      service pack 4, MS processor pack, ...).
	    - Many typo's and cosmetic changes.
	    - Update to Map2CS tutorial. Brings into line with use of
	      WorldCraft 3.3 and simplified setup and usage instructions.
	- Wouter Wijngaards did an update to the procedural sky so that
	  it looks good in software too (disabled CS_PROC_TEXTURE_ALONE_HINT
	  for the texture, so that the colormap is (re)computed in 8bit
	  mode).
	- Martin Geisse updated the apimod18.txi documentation on how
	  to go from version 0.17 to 0.18 with regards to the config
	  changes.
	- Made all the members of csRenderView private and provided
	  proper accessor functions. In particular added:
	  	- SetEngine(), GetEngine()
		- GetClipPlane()
		- SetCallback(), GetCallback(), CallCallback(),
		  GetCallbackData()
		- GetFrustum()
		- SetThisSector(), GetThisSector()
		- SetPreviousSector(), GetPreviousSector()
		- SetFogInfo(), GetFogInfo(), AddedFogInfo(), ResetFogInfo()
		- GetG3D(), GetG2D()
		- SetPortalPolygon(), GetPortalPolygon()
		- GetView()
		- HasClipPlane(), UseClipPlane()
		- HasClipFrustum(), UseClipFrustum()
	- Also added a copy constructor to csRenderView to correctly
	  fix the ref counts.
	- Since QUERY_INTERFACE does an implied IncRef() a lot of current
	  code is not correctly handling this (i.e. does not call DecRef()).
	  In addition QUERY_INTERFACE is not very efficient. So I rewrote
	  a lot of the QUERY_INTERFACE calls so that the QUERY_INTERFACE
	  result is remembered. The class remembering this result is
	  now responsible for doing DecRef() when appropriate. This should
	  make things slightly more efficient and certainly more correct:
	  Here are the places where this is done:
	  	- csView::SetCamera()
		- csRenderView::SetView()
		- csRenderView::SetEngine()
		- csRenderView::camera
	- Also fixed all of the apps where this DecRef() was missing.
	- Fixed csEngine where this DecRef() was missing.
	- Fixed csEngine::FindMeshObject() so that it will no longer crash
	  when it cannot find the mesh.
	- Fixed csEngine::FindTexture() so that it will no longer crash
	  when it cannot find the texture.
	- Fixed csEngine::FindCameraPosition() so that it will no longer
	  crash when it cannot find the texture.
	- Since csMeshWrapper is now the only class subclassing from
	  csSprite it makes better sense to merge both classes into
	  csMeshWrapper. So csSprite is now removed and the engine only
	  talks about csMeshWrapper objects. This has the following
	  additional consequences:
	  	- csEngine::sprites is renamed to csEngine::meshes
		- csEngine::UnlinkSprite/RemoveSprite renamed to <Xxx>Mesh.
		- csEngine::PrepareSprites renamed to PrepareMeshes.
		- csSector::sprites renamed to csSector::meshes
	- Updated apimod18.txi with the full info on how to port csSprite3D
	  to mesh object system.
	- Fixed MazeD so that it correctly saves the new spr3d format
	  instead of the old csSprite3D format.
	- Extended iMeshObject with HitBeamObject() function. Only
	  the spr3d plugin supports this at the moment. This is a todo
	  for the other plugin types. csMeshWrapper will call this function
	  now.
	- Martin Geisse fixed a few problems in ptlab and csview that came
	  with the removal of csSprite.
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed a compile error in terrddg.cpp.
12-Feb-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed the loading crash for csfedit. Now
	  csfedit will create a new font called 'LoadingError' when
	  loading fails.
	- Wouter also made a big quality improvement on the procedural
	  sky. Adjusted several parameters. The result is that clouds
	  look much wispier then before. This also makes the texture
	  look smoother.
	- Martin Geisse fixed a bug that crashed levtool when loading
	  a non-3d-sprite mesh object.
11-Feb-2001
	- Martin Geisse fixed a bug that crashed cctest when map file
	  was not found.
	- Martin also fixed a very old msvc compiler warning (msvc doesn't
	  like usage of 'this' pointer in member/base class initialization
	  list in constructors).
10-Feb-2001
	- Martin Geisse did the following changes to the config system:
	    - Added the config manager object. This object takes several
	      config files and makes them look like a single config object
	      to the outside.
	    - Removed Prev() method from iterators because they caused
	      problems with the config manager.
	    - Fixed a case where the dirty flag was not set.
9-Feb-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards added default =0 to csPixmap function.
	- Philip Wyett fixed memory reference errors on app exit under
	  Windows. "->DecRef ();" both cube and ball inside the destructor.
	- Added incomplete doc on transition from 0.17 to 0.18. Will work
	  further on this.
	- Added GetTransformedBoundingBox() and GetScreenBoundingBox() to
	  csMeshWrapper.
	- Changed sprite selection code in WalkTest to work on mesh objects.
	- Spr3d plugin now also implements iConfig so that you can set
	  sprite configuration options through that. Currently the supported
	  options are 'sprlod' (sprite lod level) and 'sprlq' (sprite
	  lighting quality).
	- Modified WalkTest to use the iConfig interface of the spr3d
	  plugin to implement the 'lod' and 'sprlight' console commands.
	  Added GetConfigOption() and SetConfigOption() routines in WalkTest
	  to make this easier.
	- WalkTest is now completely free of the old csSprite3D and is
	  fully converted to the new spr3d plugin.
	- Converted cctest app and csclear lib to use new spr3d plugin.
	- Added SetFactory() and GetFactory() to csMeshWrapper.
	- Added GetFactory() to iMeshObject and removed GetFactory() from
	  iSprite3DState. Changed all mesh object plugins accordingly.
	- Fixed MazeD for the new spr3d plugin.
	- Fixed Physics test appliation to use the new spr3d plugin.
	- Fixed levtool app to use the new spr3d plugin.
	- Changed GetRadius() in iMeshObject to return a csVector instead
	  of a float.
	- Completely removed csSprite3D and csSpriteTemplate from the engine.
	  This means that csFrame, csSpriteAction, csSkeleton... are all
	  gone now. Also removed csLoader::LoadSpriteTemplate and LoadSprite.
	  The 'SPRITE' keyword is no longer recognized.
	- Removed FindSprite() in iEngine, csEngine, iRegion, and csRegion and
	  added FindMeshObject() instead.
	- Removed iSprite and iSpriteTemplate interfaces.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the API transition
	  documentation:
	    - Re-organized so that there is a single appendix for API
	      transitions rather than multiple appendices.  The API transition
	      appendix now contains a sub-section for each transitional
	      version.
	    - Ran nodefix.pl (make repairdoc) to repair out of date @node and
	      @menu directives.
	    - Eliminated underfull and overfull hbox warning messages reported
	      by TeX.
	    - Performed a bit of clean up in apimod18.txi.
	- Eric Sunshine modified the Apple/NeXT system driver so that it now
	  recognizes the new defaults `CrystalSpaceRoot' and
	  `CrystalSpaceRootIgnore'.  The first setting allows the user to
	  configure the location of the root directory which contains the
	  Crystal Space resources.  This allows any Crystal Space application
	  to locate its resources even when launched from the Workspace.  The
	  reason that this is necessary, is that the Workspace launches the
	  application without providing any path information (that is, argv[0]
	  is the bare program name) and without setting the current working
	  directory to a meaningful value.  The use of this setting is similar
	  to the CRYSTAL environment variable, but since the Workspace does not
	  allow environment variables to be set, the Apple/NeXT defaults system
	  is used instead.  The second setting tells the application to ignore
	  the first variable.  This is useful in cases when the first variable
	  is set in the "global" domain, but a particular application wants to
	  ignore the setting.  The upshot of this change is that it is now
	  possible to launch Crystal Space applications via double-click in the
	  Workspace on NextStep.  Unfortunately, this does not yet work on
	  OpenStep due to some, as yet, undetermined problem where the
	  NSApplication object throws an exception.  On MacOS/X and OpenStep,
	  these defaults can be set as illustrated below:
		defaults write NSGlobalDomain CrystalSpaceRoot /Library/CS
	  On NextStep, the following command would be used:
		dwrite -g CrystalSpaceRoot /LocalLibrary/CS
8-Feb-2001
	- Martin Geisse changed DirectInput version number from 0x0700
	  to 0x0300.
	- Philip Wyett fixed VERY VERY long standing compile errors
	  in the MingW port. There are no code changes, just a code move
	  around. Still compiles in VC6. Other platforms say Linux etc.
	  will have to compile to verify this hack (and it is a hack :-))
	  is OK?
	- Changed 'bot' code in Walktest and ptlab to use the new spr3d
	  plugin instead of csSprite3D.
	- Initialization of collision detection in WalkTest will now work
	  for all mesh objects that actually support iPolygonMesh (currently
	  only spr3d plugin does this).
	- Fixed spr3d plugin so that GenerateLOD() and ComputeBoundingBox()
	  will now be called upon the first creation of a sprite instance
	  from a factory. Previously this was not done so this could give
	  problems.
	- Changed csDrawCallback in meshobj.h to use iMeshWrapper and
	  iRenderView instead of csMeshWrapper and csRenderView.
	- Extended iMeshWrapper interface with SetDrawCallback() and
	  GetDrawCallback().
	- Added 'add_meshobj' to walktest which is equivalent to 'add_sprite'.
	- Ported the skeletal tree from WalkTest to use the new spr3d
	  plugin.
	- Added ObjAdd(), ObjRemove(), ObjRelease(), and GetObjectParentI()
	  to iObject SCF interface so that they can be used from within
	  plugins too.
	- Added a new constructor to csCollider which accepts an iObject*
	  as a parent. This will help to attach csCollider objects to
	  mesh object plugins.
	- Fixed bug in csMeshWrapper. It did not use the correct SCF macros
	  to indicate that it was actually getting iBase from the parent
	  csSprite.
	- Fixed a bug in the spr3d plugin where it would reset the value
	  of MixMode to CS_FX_COPY the first time it was used.
	- Converted the crossbuilder importer (i.e. the routines that can
	  read MD2 and 3DS files to sprite templates) so that they use
	  the new spr3d plugins.
	- Added support for 'FILE' in MESHOBJ for factories. This is only
	  temporary. The real solution is to move the 3DS and MDL/MD2 loaders
	  which are now in impexp to plugins similar to the spr3dldr plugin.
	  For now you can use this to import such a sprite template. If
	  you use 'FILE' then you don't have to specify a 'PLUGIN' or use
	  the 'PARAMS' statement. In addition also supported the MATERIAL
	  keyword to set the material here. Note that you should only use
	  MATERIAL in combination with the FILE keyword. In normal use
	  MATERIAL is part of the PARAMS statement and parsed by the plugin.
	- Converted Squawk to use the new spr3d plugin.
	- Added 'loadmesh' and 'addmesh' console commands which complement
	  the old 'loadsprite' and 'addsprite' commands. These work for
	  meshes now. 'loadsprite' and 'addsprite' are now deleted.
	- Renamed 'delsprite' to 'delmesh'.
	- Renamed 'listsprites' to 'listmeshes'.
	- 'listactions', 'setaction', and 'setmotion' use the new spr3d
	  plugin system too. As a consequence, they no longer work for
	  the old sprites.
	- Changed name of csTriangleVertex to csTriangleVertex2 temporarily
	  in spr3d plugin so that static build works again. After csSprite3D
	  is removed this can be restored.
7-Feb-2001
	- Martin Geisse removed sound volume division by number of sources
	  from software sound because it did not sound very good.
	- Martin also fixed an old bug with distorted 8-bit software sound.
	- Philip Wyett added missing line: "virtual void NextFrame ();"
	  dec into section 5.2.4 of the Simple tutorial.
	  The fact of this ommission was brought to my attention
	  by Menachem Pastreich - Thanks :-)
	- Philip also fixed a compile error in gamecore with regards to
	  the move of cspixmap.h from csengine to csfx.
	- Wouter Wijngaards added missing CreateInstance routine to
	  csAnimationTemplate.
	- Wouter also ixed another bug: the order of pushes in
	  csAnimationTemplate::AddFrame was wrong. Also fixed the
	  GetLength(). csAnimationTemplate and csAnimatedPixmap
	  work now. (Tested in Tunnel Fighter).
	- Converted the missile in walktest to use the new mesh object
	  spr3d plugin instead of csSprite3D. Also modified standard.zip
	  accordingly.
	- Finished support for spr3dldr (added support for TWEEN and
	  ACTION). Now it can correctly load sprites.
	- Added SCF interface iMeshWrapper which is the SCF version of
	  csMeshWrapper. Also put a few functions in there so that it
	  is possible to actually use it.
	- Added CreateMeshFactory() and CreateMeshObject() conveniance
	  functions to iEngine. The first one creates a factory and the
	  second one will create a mesh object given a factory and place
	  it correctly in the world.
	- Updated simple to use the new conveniance functions.
	- Norman Kramer started optimizing AVI plugin using u/v pipe.
	- Added csLoader::LoadMeshObjectFactory() to load mesh object
	  factories.
	- Simple now uses mesh object system for the sprite too.
6-Feb-2001
	- Continue implementation of spr3d loader plugin. The factory
	  loader should work now.
	- Added support for loading MESHOBJ factories in library files.
	- Also added spr2d and spr2dldr to walkall because the explosion
	  needs it.
	- Eric and Jorrit fixed a bad bug in spr3d which caused the entire
	  system driver to be included in the plugin. Plugins should not
	  link with plugins. But if they do then can only use iSystem and
	  not anything inside cssys (like fatal_exit in this case).
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a couple copy/paste errors in linex2d.mak which
	  were pointed out by Jan Dvorak <johnydog@go.cz>.
	- Martin Geisse did the following changes to cspixmap and
	  csanimation2d:
	    - Moved both from csengine to csfx.
	    - csPixmap is now a more general interface-like class.
	    - csSimplePixmap is now what csPixmap was before.
	    - Changed the animation system to work on a template-instance
	      basis.  Templates are called csAnimationTemplate and instances
	      of a template are called csAnimatedPixmap. These instances
	      inherit from csPixmap.
	    - Animations can now handle frames with different delay values.
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed a bug in csfedit where the mouse would draw
	  on the character when the mouse was not down.
	- Norman Kramer fixed a scaling bug in the AVI plugin.
5-Feb-2001
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a couple compilation warnings in
	  csfedit.cpp.
	- Added GetFOVAngle() to iCamera.
	- Created the spr3d plugin (untested). The old csSprite3D is still
	  there and will remain there until everything is ported to the
	  new plugin. I also still have to implement spr3dldr (the loader).
	- Added spr3d, spr3dldr, explo, and exploldr targets to 'walkall'
	  because these are really required by WalkTest.
	- Started work on spr3dldr (the Sprite3D loader plugin). The
	  plugin currently works but only supports a tiny subset of what
	  needs to be supported (i.e. not enough to be useful).
	- Wouter Wijngaards changed csPixmap to allow subclassing. Made
	  a subclass of csPixmap, that is csAnim2D - an animated pixmap.
	  Each time you draw the correct frame of the animation is
	  substituted, and drawn. Use like a csPixmap, and redraw each frame
	  (if not already a 2d overdraw).
	- Wouter removed the already present csAnimation2D in csengine.
	- Norman Kramer did the following:
	    - Fixed bug in the c yuv2rgba routine: u,v values were taken
	      for 4 sequential pixel, instead the were meant for a 2x2
	      pixelblock.
	    - Started NASM mmx routine for yuv2rgba: doesnt work yet and
	      is not scheduled either.
	- Removed glu.h includes from OpenGL plugins. We don't need it and it
	  adds an unneeded dependency.
4-Feb-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards changed includes, so that make depend works
	  nicer for csfedit.
	- Norman Kramer fixed a bug in the AVI plugin. Red and blue
	  chrominance values were swapped.
3-Feb-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards added full functionality to the .csf font
	  editor. You can edit characters, see a preview, change individual
	  character widths, change font names, widths, save, load, etc.
	- Philip Wyett started integration of DivX into CS tree.
	- Philip also added plggamecore and added "DSP.GCORE.LIBS = xmlparse"
	  to generate correct VC6 project file and fix link errors in
	  the plugin.
2-Feb-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards continued work on csfedit. You can now load
	  a font (or make a new font) and see its contents in a window.
	  The window also has working scrollbars now.
	- Norman Kramer added initialization of pG2D to NULL (for avi plugin).
	- Fixed a compile error in csfedit (only in debug mode) and
	  fixed the makefile so that the description of the make target
	  aligns correctly with the other descriptions.
	- Extended iSkeletonConnectionState with GetTransformation() and
	  SetTransformation().
	- csSprite3D now implements iSprite3DState (similar to the work that
	  has been done yesterday on csSpriteTemplate).
	- Walktest now uses this new iSprite3DState for the skeleton and
	  the ghost.
	- Eric Sunshine enabled generation of MSVC DSP files for the csPython
	  plug-in module and the PySimp application since we have one or two
	  Windows users who would like to build these modules.
	- Martin Geisse fixed two bugs in the sound system.
1-Feb-2001
	- Martin Geisse changed the sockets driver to use system events
	  instead of Open() and Close() methods.
	- Martin also fixed a bug which caused the sound drivers to stop
	  'open', 'close' and 'pre-process' system events from further
	  processing.
	- Norman Kramer set ApplicationShow to SW_SHOWNORMAL in main().
	  For some reason the mingw links main and not WinMain for guio
	  apps. In that case ApplicationShow was initialized to 0 which
	  means HIDE which in turn was the reason the window was invisible
	  when running with opengl/mingw. I remember that it worked before,
	  so probably some linker options slightly changed when linking
	  with mingw - I dont know.
	- Wouter Wijngaards added the csf edit application (font editor).
	  Now it can read files. Note that the csws querydialog for
	  filedialog now only returns full system paths. Not VFS paths.
	  I worked around (prob. unix specific) using stat() and fread().
	- Philip Wyett updated levtool to take account of Andrew's changes
	  yesterday. Move to csTreeBox and changed to new mouse handler
	  csevMouseClick. App now compiles and runs OK again under Windows.
	- Philip also added new avi plugin to autogeneration process. This
	  will generate both the VC6 project files for the plugin and
	  the test application.
	- Added GetAnmIndex() and GetTexIndex() to iSpriteFrame.
	- Added MergeNormals() to iSprite3DFactoryState.
	- Changed csLoader to use the new iSkeletonLimb, iSkeletonConnection,
	  iSkeleton, and iSprite3DFactoryState to load a sprite template.
	  Only partially done though. The impexp loaders still need a pointer
	  to csSpriteTemplate.
	- Fixed QUERY_INTERFACE_SAFE so that it doesn't evaluate it's
	  parameters multiple times.
	- Changed skeletal demos in WalkTest to use the new
	  iSprite3DFactoryState interface (and related).
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a serious bug in cspython.cpp where the contents
	  of several csString objects was potentially being used _after_ the
	  csString was destroyed.  This was one of those object-lifetime
	  issues which differ from compiler to compiler.
31-Jan-2001
	- Martin Geisse fixed a compile-time error in CSWS.
	- Added GetPrivateObject() to iMaterialWrapper.
	- Added QUERY_INTERFACE_SAFE() which will first test if the given
	  object is NULL. In that case it will return NULL. Otherwise
	  equivalent to QUERY_INTERFACE().
	- Let csSpriteTemplate implement iSprite3DFactoryState. This is in
	  preparation of the csSprite3D move to a plugin.
	- Norman Kramer did further work on the video plugins:
	    - Extended PLUGIN var to build AVI and optionally opendivx.
	    - Added output of what is currently done when trying to load video.
	- Philip Wyett altered path to file 'video.avi' to data directory.
	- Andrew Zabolotny did the following changes to CS:
	    - Now the toolbox toolbar tracks the active editor window
	      (model or world) and changes accordingly. I have drawn a few
	      more icons for MazeD in GIMP, and switched the toolbar
	      texture format to truecolor PNG with alpha channel. Now
	      toolbar icons can have (and some already have) semi-transparent
	      parts :-)
	    - CSWS buttons with pictures are grayed (pictures are displayed
	      semi-transparent) when the buttons are disabled. Also they do
	      not emit the cscmdRightButtonClick message when they are
	      disabled (in MazeD this was manifesting as second-level
	      toolbars popping up even from disabled buttons).
	    - Floating hints will disappear properly even if some window
	      has captured the focus (such as a dialog window). To do so
	      they grab the mouse.
	    - Rewrote much of the csTreeCtrl (treeview) control. The
	      basical interface is very similar (except that I've renamed
	      csTreeCtrl into csTreeBox); most of the changes are related
	      to the internal implementation. Other features: a completely
	      new look-and-feel; a extended, more flexible and less
	      cumbersome API (and a simpler implementation). Also I have
	      changed cswstest so that you can switch miscelaneous tree
	      control styles at runtime and see them in effect instantly
	      (like for notebook control).
	    - Made the csLayout class to set the CSS_TRANSPARENT flag
	      (again?) since otherwise the dialog background "under" the
	      layout isn't drawn, and since the layout itself does not paint
	      anything, you get an hall-of-mirrors like effect (when you
	      move the window).
	    - Dialogs with no children will SuggestSize 8x8 rather than
	      2x2 like it did before. This allows for better identification
	      of windows with wrongly set CSWS_TOOLBAR style bit set :-)
	      (toolbar is a dialog too, so if you wrongly set this bit when
	      creating the window, you'll get just a couple of thin black
	      lines which are confusing, at least they were for me :-)
	    - Changed a little the behaviour of csComponent::NextChild()
	      and PrevChild(): now it returns the next/previous *visible*
	      and selectable child rather than just selectable. This has
	      the effect of not showing anymore the hidden windows when
	      closing a visible window (per Jorrit's request). However, if
	      there is nothing left than hidden window, a hidden window
	      will be focused anyway (but not shown).
	    - Changed a little listbox behaviour and look. No lightblue
	      frame on the focused item anymore; when listbox is active,
	      the focused item is denoted by a solid background, otherwise
	      it is denoted with a thin frame of the same color.
	    - Added a method csComponent::OtherToThis (csComponent, x&, y&)
	      which will convert coordinates from coordinate system of
	      other component to this component's coordinate system. This
	      is faster than the using the LocalToGlobal -> GlobalToLocal
	      pair if the `from' component is a child (or grandchild, or
	      grandgrandchild etc) of `this' component.
	    - Made the toolbars resizeable in MazeD. By default toolbars
	      are now four buttons wide (rather than two like it was
	      before), to reserve a little space for coming "world tree"
	      and "material selector" toolbars.
	    - Added a new kind of events: csevMouseClick. This is generated
	      by mouse event manager (AKA mouse driver) when it detects that
	      the mouse button has been pressed and then released within
	      "DoubleClickTime" and the mouse haven't been moved further
	      than "DoubleClickDist". That is, when you quickly press and
	      release the mouse button twice in sequence, you will
	      generate the next events:
		csevMouseDown
		csevMouseUp
		csevMouseClick (at the same time with MouseUp)
		* This event is emmited only if the mouse haven't moved too
		* far between MouseDown and MouseUp and the time between
		* them haven't exceeded some threshold value.
		csevMouseDown
		csevMouseDoubleClick (at the same with MouseDown)
		* This event is also generated if the same conditions are true.
		csevMouseUp
		csevMouseClick (at the same time with MouseUp)
		* Yet another mouse click event, if the conditions are met.
	      You can notice a slight conceptual difference in Click and
	      DoubleClick because Click is generated after mouse is
	      released, and DoubleClick is generated when mouse is pressed.
	      Well, this is so for historical reasons - most GUIs uses
	      mouse this way.
	      ---
	      Also note that the behaviour of double clicks event has
	      slightly changed: now DoubleClick is emmited *in addition*
	      to MouseDown rather than *instead* like it was before. That is,
	      you will *always* get all the MouseDown and MouseUp events
	      disregarding whenever click and doubleclick events have
	      occured; these events are additional and are introduced just
	      to help the programmer to track these conditions; in general
	      he could do it himself by using timer, remembering position etc.
	      ---
	      This has a slight impact on some seldom-encountered code
	      sequences: if before to catch absolutely all mousedown
	      events you had to catch both MouseDown and MouseDoubleClick
	      events, now you have to catch just MouseDown and don't bother
	      about MouseClick and MouseDoubleClick - the event you are
	      looking for will be always emited. In fact, if you will
	      leave the code as before, you will intercept now two
	      events instead of one; while in most cases it doesn't matter,
	      in some cases it can.
	    - Added a small context menu to every toolbar in MazeD.
	    - Started implementing world tree toolbar. Now it is one of the
	      standard toolbars. It displays in a tree fashion the structure
	      of the 3D world. At the "top" level there can be only sectors
	      (AKA rooms), inside them you can nest things and sprites
	      (but not rooms).
	    - Remove ?= from assignment to CSSYS.OBJ since GNU Make 3.77
	      doesn't expand the text after such an assignment. That is,
	      "CSSYS.OBJ ?= $(...)" is treated literally, e.g. the text
	      inside the brackets is not expanded. If someone really needs
	      ?=, use ifndef instead -- although I don't see any assignments
	      to CSSYS.OBJ, so I can't understand why somebody have put ?=
	      there.
	    - Removed "dep: ..." after last line of "clean:" target - it
	      seems like traces of a CVS conflict introduced by someone in CVS.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed cssys.mak to again support conditional setting
	  of OBJ.CSSYS.  (This feature was disabled in the most recent
	  revision).
	- Eric Sunshine fixed video.mak so that the `vid' target only appears
	  in the application list if the platform is also able to build
	  video-related plugins.  Also fixed formatting of help message.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed several compilation problems in MazeD and CSWS.
	  Also resolved some const vs. non-const problems in these modules.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a slew of compilation warnings in cswstest.cpp.
30-Jan-2001
	- Norman Kramer did further work on the video plugins:
	    - Removed some debug code and a stupid comment.
	    - Divx codec works (AVI).
	    - For opengl the pic is flipped vertically , eek (this is because I
	      abused the csImageArea and filled it myself while it was actually
	      meant to be filled by the renderer.  Jorrit talked about
	      introducing a FillPixelArray, which should solve this problem -
	      or the csImageArea can be extended to do that ).
	- Eric Sunshine changed the behavior of the -simdepth option in the
	  AppKit-based Apple/NeXT 2D driver.  If the user specifies an illegal
	  depth, then a suitable warning message is issued and the request is
	  ignored.  Previously, it would return a failure status from
	  iGraphics2D::Initialize() in this circumstance.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed SED_DEPEND in cs.mak so that it works more
	  portably across different versions of GNU make.  In particular, the
	  old definition failed to work correctly on MacOS/X Server 1.0
	  (Rhapsody).
	- Martin Geisse eliminated a few compiler warnings in csgfxldr,
	  glcommon2d.cpp and MazeD.
	- Martin also eliminated a few cases where options have different
	  names in walktest sources and in config file.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed potential a memory leak which Martin introduced
	  in glcommon2d.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed CS/include/cssys/next/csosdefs.h so that it
	  respects SYSDEF_ACCESS.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to jobber.pl:
	    - Now allows user-specification of the temporary working directory
	      (default is "/tmp").
	    - Added a --version option.
29-Jan-2001
	- Martin also modified the sound drivers so that they are now opened,
	  closed, and updated via system events.
	- Brandon Ehle added documentation for the Skeletal Animation format,
	  and the INCLUDESPRITE macro.
	- Philip Wyett added a divide by zero check in csSprite3D.  This fixes
	  ptlab on Windows.
	- Jorrit fixed the fix from Philip Wyett to make it slightly more
	  robust.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a bug in csConfigFile where the SetInt(),
	  SetFloat(), and SetBool() methods would not actually set the key
	  of a newly created node if the value being set was 0, 0.0, or false,
	  respectively.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a bug in csConfigFile where the SetInt(),
	  SetFloat(), and SetBool() methods were applying `delete[]' to the
	  Data value twice.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the project:
	    - Added a makefile (macosx.mak) for MacOS/X.  This makefile is for
	      Apple's new MacOS/X platform using the Cocoa-based Apple/NeXT
	      port.  Since I do not have access to either MacOS/X or recent
	      Macintosh hardware, this makefile is currently untested, but I
	      believe that the project should build cleanly.
	    - Added new menu definition to next.cfg for MacOS/X which respects
	      the new Aqua-style interface.  This differs from the existing
	      menu definition for MacOS/X Server 1.0 (Rhapsody) which is
	      specific to the Platinum-style interface.
	    - Eliminated reliance upon the Objective-C++ compiler for the
	      Apple/NeXT port by reorganizing the code and writing plain-C
	      stubs which interface between the C++ world of Crystal Space and
	      the Objective-C world of the AppKit frameworks of Cocoa,
	      OpenStep, and NextStep.  By eliminating the need for an
	      Objective-C++ compiler, the project can now be built on MacOS/X
	      (which does not ship with an Objective-C++ compiler).  The
	      port-specific .cpp files now contain only pure C++ code.  All of
	      the Objective-C code has been moved to .m files.  (The standard
	      file extension for Objective-C source files is .m.)
	    - Added icursor.h.  This is a pure-C header which contains the
	      csMouseCursorID constants which used to reside in igraph2d.h.
	      Also added ievdefs.h.  This is a pure-C header which contains all
	      of the event-related constants which used to reside in ievent.h.
	      These files are pure-C, rather than C++, because they must be
	      included by the Objective-C source files of the Apple/NeXT port.
	    - Added NeXTDynamicLibrary.cpp, which is the C++ portion of the
	      plugin loading facility for the Apple/NeXT ports.  The existing
	      NeXTLoadLibrary.m is now pure Objective-C and publishes a plain-C
	      interface for use by NeXTDynamicLibrary.
	    - Added NeXTConfigFile which is a plain-C wrapper over the C++
	      Crystal Space configuration facility.
	    - Added rules and support facilities to the Apple/NeXT makefile
	      (next.mak) for recognition and compilation of Objective-C (.m)
	      files.  Also added Objective-C support to next2d.mak.
	    - cssys.mak now sets OBJ.CSSYS conditionally; only if it has not
	      already been set.  This allows the platform-specific makefile to
	      override the list of object files for the system driver.  This
	      facility is used by the Apple/NeXT port to mention Objective-C
	      (.m) object files in OBJ.CSSYS as well as C and C++ files.
	    - cssys.mak now automatically invokes `vpath' for all C files in
	      the system driver source directories (in addition to the `vpath'
	      for C++ files which it has always invoked).
	    - NeXTSystemDriver::SystemExtension() understands the following new
	      messages: "timerfired", "continuelooping", "continuerunning",
	      "dispatchevent", "hidemouse", "showmouse", and "requestshutdown".
	    - De-coupled the tight binding which existed between the
	      AppKit-based NeXT 2D canvas and the NeXT system driver's
	      Objective-C delegate.  Some of the functionality in NeXTDelegate
	      was actually specific to the AppKit-based canvas and may not have
	      been useful or correct for other drivers, such as the planned
	      OpenGL and CoreGraphics drivers.  The following functionality has
	      been moved from NeXTDelegate into the canvas plugin:
		o Setting of "Paused" status message on window when application
		  is suspended.  The canvas now listens for cscmdFocusChanged
		  events to implement this behavior.
		o Creation and management of the window's tracking-rectangle as
		  well as the associated behavior.
		o Window event mask management.
		o Window position adjustment for video optimization.
		o Response to user initiated window-close events.
	      Other functionality which may be useful to any canvas
	      implementation for Apple/NeXT is published by the system driver
	      via iSystem::SystemExtension().  The messages which may be useful
	      to 2D drivers include "dispatchevent", "keydown", "keyup",
	      "mousedown", "mouseup", "mousemoved", "hidemouse", "showmouse",
	      and "requestshutdown".  Furthermore, the canvas no longer
	      communicates directly with the system driver's Objective-C proxy
	      object; nor vice-versa.  All platform-specific communication with
	      the system driver is now accomplished via
	      iSystem::SystemExtension().
	    - The default NeXT 2D canvas plugin no longer includes
	      NeXTDelegate.h from the CS/libs/cssys/next directory.  2D drivers
	      now communicate with the platform-specific library strictly via
	      iSystemDriver::SystemExtension().
	    - The Objective-C application delegate in the Apple/NeXT port now
	      listens for application-activation and application-deactivation
	      notifications in order to suspend and resume the engine rather
	      than relying on window-activation and window-deactivation
	      messages.  Not only is this more sensible, but it also helped to
	      de-couple the AppKit-based 2D canvas from the system driver.
	    - Fixed a simple logic problem in the AppKit-based Apple/NeXT 2D
	      graphics driver where it failed to emit a warning message when
	      the user selected an invalid display depth via the -simdepth
	      option.
	    - The AppKit-based 2D canvas for the Apple/NeXT port no longer
	      relies upon the WindowServer to report its own preferred
	      bit-depth.  It turns out (so I discovered) that this is an
	      unreliable operation on OpenStep since the WindowServer will
	      actually report a different value the very first time the program
	      is run versus subsequent runs.  Instead, the driver now relies
	      upon the preferred depth as reported by the NSWindow or Window
	      class.
	    - Mouse tracking in the canvas' window is now more accurate when
	      user switches away from the window or application and then
	      returns.  In particular, the driver now pays attention to the
	      mouse's location at the time that it once again begins tracking
	      the mouse.
	    - Fixed a problem with the AppKit-based Apple/NeXT 2D driver.  If
	      the mouse was hidden prior to the application being paused, it
	      would not be re-hidden when the application resumed.
	    - The special CFLAGS needed to build the AppKit-based 2D driver
	      (next2d.mak) are now only applied when explicitly building that
	      driver rather than being applied to all modules.
	    - Added a new `inherit' keyword to the list of keywords understood
	      by NeXTMenu when processing a menu item entry.  This keyword
	      allows a menu item to inherit attributes from some other menu
	      item.  These attributes can then be overridden locally.  This
	      facility is useful, for example, when one menu item definition
	      differs from another only by its title.
	    - Added a copious amount of documentation to next.cfg describing
	      all of the supported configuration options.
	    - Fixed a bug in NeXTMenu on NextStep where it would fail to
	      properly build submenus on account of a mis-constructed submenu
	      key prefix.
	    - Converted NeXTMenu and NeXTConfigFile to work with new
	      csConfigFile and related SCF interfaces rather than the
	      deprecated csIniFile.
	    - Fixed vfs.cfg so that it works with MacOS/X Server again
	      following Andrew's change to the meaning of CS_PLATFORM_NAME.
	    - Fixed the Apple/NeXT system driver and next.cfg so that they once
	      again work following andrew's change to the meaning of
	      CS_PLATFORM_NAME.  More importantly, re-added the
	      OS_NEXT_DESCRIPTION macro since it is needed to properly
	      distinguish between platform options in next.cfg.  This is
	      necessary since the menu layout differs between MacOS/X and
	      MacOS/X Server 1.0 (Rhapsody).  However, Andrew's change made it
	      impossible to make this distinction.
	    - Fixed the csMaterial(csTextureWrapper*) constructor so that it
	      works correctly for the Apple/NeXT platforms when the engine is
	      used as a plugin module.  The problem was that this constructor
	      was invoking another constructor in the same class.  The result
	      of invoking a constructor in this situation is undefined at best
	      since the C++ specification leaves the behavior up to the
	      compiler implementation.  In this case, the result was that none
	      of the instance variables, except `texture', were being
	      initialized.  In particular, the lack of initialization of the
	      SCF goop resulted in IncRef() being called infinitely.  Having
	      fixed this bug, Simplep finally works on Apple/NeXT.
	    - Fixed a problem where many `friend' functions of ddgMatrix4 and
	      ddgVector2 were not declared as `inline' in the respective
	      headers.  This resulted in implementations of these functions
	      appearing in every file which included those headers, which
	      ultimately caused linkage errors.
	    - Eliminated all remaining imports of the deprecated <malloc.h>
	      from platform-independent project sources files.  (Some
	      platform-specific files may still include malloc.h, though.)
	    - Eliminated several compilation warnings reported by the OpenStep
	      compiler throughout the project regarding implicit conversion of
	      void* to some other type.
	    - Eliminated a compilation warning reported by CodeWarrior in
	      csEventQueue::Lock().  The compiler did not like the empty
	      statement following the while() loop.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a overfull hbox TeX warning in meshobj/using.txi.
	- Martin Geisse changed csConfigFile and iConfigFileNew so that
	  comments at the end of a file are now preserved and can be modified
	  by the application.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the following problems in csConfigFile introduced
	  by Martin's changes:
	    - Fixed a dangling-pointer bug in csConfigFile::Clear().
	    - Fixed several problem spots in csConfigFile::LoadFromBuffer()
	      where it could assign the wrong comment as the "end-of-file"
	      comment.
	- Philip Wyett changed dnp_tab.cpp to include malloc.h on Windows.
	- Eric Sunshine reverted Philip's change to dnp_tab.cpp and solved the
	  missing malloc.h problem in a different fashion.  The problem with
	  Philip's change was that his #if test was not well formed, and he
	  also forgot to apply the change to CS/support/gnu/bison.sim, from
	  which dnp_tab.cpp is built.
28-Jan-2001
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a crasher in PTLab where it was trying to
	  access a texture (cslogo.gif) which it had never loaded.
	- Philip Wyett removed the reference to the non-existant texture
	  archive at http://server.empathy.com/crystal.
	- Norman Kramer fixed Save & RestoreArea in iGraphics2D to be
	  good with PixelBytes == 2.
	- Norman also did some fixes on the OpenGL texture cache:
	    - Texture size on caching is now only calculated when needed.
	    - Keycolor setting is now remembered so that it is not processed
	      again when texture handle is created again.
27-Jan-2001
	- Martin Geisse moved the main system/application config files to the
	  new config system.
	- Martin Geisse fixed a bug in the sound loader.
26-Jan-2001
	- Norman Kramer did further work on the video plugins.
	  With exception of yuv2rgb conversion AVI is working.
	- Wouter Wijngaards did nothing important to radiosity.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a compilation warning in prsky.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine Made the following changes to inifile.cpp:
	    - Eliminated compilation warnings about implicit conversion of
	      void* to some other type.
	    - GetYesNo() now also recognizes "1" as true in addition to "yes",
	      "true", and "on".
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed several bugs in radiosity:
	    - Normals when really close up for both lumels. Taking only one
	      normal value would give bad results. This the code now averages
	      for the corners of all lumels.
	    - Set source_patch_size in the config to 1 (did not debug that
	      yet). Vectors a,b when a*b is taken (to get cosinus), lengths
	      must be one. a*b/length(a)/length(b) is only a valid approx
	      when both a and b are pretty large. Close to zero this fails.
	    - When lumels overlap in space (i.e. two polygons with the same
	      texture seamlessly aligning) the distance would become almost
	      zero. Added a test, and at such a moment a derivative of
	      radiosity is applied (the diffuse*area*visibility/PI is taken,
	      no angles/distances are used). This seems to remove all
	      glitches from the radtest level.
	    - To avoid light explosion with radiosity we do a Normalize()
	      for each step now.
25-Jan-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed mazed compilation, by adding csutil
	  library after the cssys for linking.
	- Norman Kramer is still working hard on the new video codec plugins.
24-Jan-2001
	- Small update to Python scripting system.
	- Norman Kramer added dummy audio stream and did some further work
	  on AVI support.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to csConfigFile and
	  iConfigFileNew:
	    - Added SubsectionExists(), which is similar to KeyExists() except
	      that it tests if at least one key exists with the supplied
	      prefix, rather than testing if a particular key exists.
	    - Renamed KeyExist() to KeyExists().
	    - Added GetVFS() to complement existing GetFileName().
	    - Renamed arguments in several method prototypes to clarify and
	      better document their usage and intention.
	    - Upgraded and clarified header comments.  Also removed incorrect
	      references to INI-format files from comments.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to csConfigFile:
	    - Now preserves blank lines in configuration files at save time
	      instead of folding them out.  The blank lines are considered part
	      of the comments.
	    - Fixed bug: SaveNow() was not respecting assertion made by
	      comments in header that a comment could be present but empty.
	    - Now performs more thorough whitespace checking in
	      LoadFromBuffer().
	    - Eliminated the ugly `goto' statements from LoadFromBuffer().
	    - Fixed bug: LoadFromBuffer() was not properly handling CRLF line
	      terminators (though it was handling LF and CR individually).
	    - LoadFromBuffer() now keeps track of the line number of the file
	      being parsed.
	    - LoadFromBuffer() now emits diagnostic messages if it encounters
	      parse errors rather than silently ignoring them.
	    - Fixed bug: LoadFromBuffer() was setting the comment on a node
	      even if the source file did not include a comment.
	    - The methods SetStr(), SetInt(), SetFloat(), SetBool(), and
	      SetComment() are now much smarter about setting the Dirty flag,
	      and only do so if the new value actually differs from the old.
	    - GetBool() now recognizes the string "1" as true in addition to
	      "true", "yes", and "on".
	    - Augmented FindNode() so that it can search for a subsection as
	      well as a full key.  This functionality is used by the new
	      SubsectionExists() method.
	    - csConfigIterator::CheckSubsection() now works correctly when
	      enumerating the entire database (rather than just a subsection).
	    - Resolved several const vs.  non-const issues.  Eliminated the
	      ugly casting of pointers from const to non-const.
	    - Moved the csConfigNode and csConfigIterator class declarations
	      out of cfgfile.h and into cfgfile.cpp.  These are entirely
	      private classes, so there was no need to publish them in a public
	      header.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed scfreg so that it works with the new csConfigFile
	  class.  (Martin forgot to do this when he converted SCF to use the
	  new configuration file format.  The result was that scfreg would
	  blast the contents of scf.cfg.)
	- Eric Sunshine augmented cspython.mak so that it is more permissive
	  about locating the Python static link library.
23-Jan-2001
	- Martin Geisse moved the following to the new config system:
	    - SCF.
	    - Map2CS.
	    - Freetype plugin.
	    - Funcon plugin.
	- Norman Kramer created new stream interface iStream, iAudioStream,
	  iVideoStream, iCodec, iStreamIterator and iStreamFormat. These
	  are mainly for the new video plugins.
	- Norman Kramer did a beginning of AVI implementation (where the
	  opendivx will live as an CODEC). Dont try to compile :)
	- Norman also reorganized the new video plugin system a bit (for
	  playing video's on a texture).
	- Wouter Wijngaards improved texture alignment for the procedural
	  sky. Now colors are computed for the center of a texel - not a
	  corner point.
22-Jan-2001
	- Norman Kramer added a plugin for opendivx (MP4 decoder), note
	  that you need the decoder lib from www.projectmayo.com (its
	  opensource). Plugin compiles now, gonna test it tonite.
	- Removed support from sprites and lights for an old and never-used
	  dynamic lighting registration system. If we still need this later
	  we'll have to redo it another way.
	- Extended iSprite3DState a bit.
	- Extended iMeshObject with GetRadius() function which will return
	  the radius of the object in object space. Also added GetRadius()
	  to csMeshWrapper.
	- Extended all mesh object plugins to support this function.
21-Jan-2001
	- Martin Geisse moved the following modules to the new config system:
	    - Glide renderer/canvas.
	    - DirectX renderer/canvas.
	    - Null renderer.
	    - OpenGL renderer/canvas.
	    - Software renderer.
	- Wouter Wijngaards added intersection point caching to the
	  procedural sky. Speed improvement is only 10%, using several
	  Megs of memory.
20-Jan-2001
	- Martin Geisse removed the remaining entries about the DirectX 5
	  renderer from the config files.
	- Wyatt Miler fixed compiling problems with Codewarrior 6.
	  Also a temporary hack for Codewarrior 6. CW 4&5 users should see
	  if this still works for you.
	- Philip Wyett added include for csgeom/transfrm.h to rain and
	  snow plugins.
19-Jan-2001
	- Martin Geisse moved the following modules to the new config system:
	    - Sound modules
	- Fixed a 'delete' vs 'new[]' bug in csPolygonSet and csSprite3D.
	- Fixed the bug which Martin Geisse reported with sprite frames
	  and actions. They were contained within a csNamedObjVector
	  which is not right because they are not csObject's.
	- Added a 'virtual' to the destructor of the new ini file stuff
	  because otherwise gcc gave warnings.
	- Extended iMeshObject with HardTransform() to do a hard
	  transform on the object. Also added this to csMeshWrapper.
	  Also added SupportsHardTransform() so that an application
	  can test if HardTransform() is supported.
	- Extended iMeshObjectFactory with the same two functions. Sometimes
	  HardTransform() only makes sense on the factory.
	- Implemented HardTransform() in all mesh object plugins. Note
	  that this transformation doesn't affect the orientation of
	  the mesh object. Only the location is changed. Even for particle
	  systems and cube although it could be useful there.
	  Note that for spr2d, snow, and rain HardTransform() don't do
	  anything.
	- Fixed a bug in ball plugin if some setting was changed after
	  already being initialized.
	- Eric Sunshine removed some old COM (pre-SCF) goop from the Macintosh
	  port.
18-Jan-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed Martin's stricmp() in cfgfile.cpp.
	  stricmp is not portable, please use strcasecmp.
	- Martin Geisse added a new module for configuration files with
	  another format than INI. This format uses a flat list of config
	  files with pseudo-hierarchy instead of the sections in INI
	  files. The new system is intended to replace the current system
	  soon.
	- Martin also moved the dungeon plug-in to the new config system
	  and fixed some bugs in both modules.
	- Extended iMeshObject interface with SetVisibleCallback() and
	  GetVisibleCallback(). This function will essentially provide
	  the same functionality as SetDrawCallback2() does for csSprite3D.
	  i.e. callback the application when the object is really (or almost
	  really) visible. Note that you are not allowed to significantly
	  change the layout, position or anything else that might affect
	  visibility in this callback (for obvious reasons).
	- Modified all the current mesh object plugins to support this new
	  callback.
	- Added SetDrawCallback() and GetDrawCallback() to csMeshWrapper.
	  This has the same functionality as the SetDrawCallback() in
	  csSprite3D. i.e. this callback is called when the object is
	  considered for drawing. This means that there is a chance it
	  is visible (but not guaranteed). It is allowed to do minor
	  changes to geometry here as long as you don't change the sectors
	  where this object lives.
	- Added support for frames and actions to iSprite3DFactoryState.
	- Fixed Mazed for my iSpriteFrame changes yesterday.
17-Jan-2001
	- Wouter Windows added more error messages to openglwin32 canvas.
	- Martin Geisse removed current support for threading from the
	  wave-out driver because it produced strange gaps in sound output.
	  It was a bug in the concept. This does not mean that threading
	  won't be supported at all, but not the way it was done till
	  now. Wave-Out is now based on function callback mode, which is
	  also modified to remove the sound gaps.
	- Renamed iskeleton.h to iskel.h to make it work on DOS.
	- Extended iskel.h with several new interface to represent the
	  skeleton structure of a 3D sprite: iSkeletonLimb,
	  iSkeletonConnection, iSkeleton, iSkeletonLimbState,
	  iSkeletonConnectionState, and iSkeletonState. iSkeletonBone
	  is retained and moved to iskelbon.h. It is used by the motion
	  manager and independent as it could be implemented by other
	  bone systems.
	- The skeleton state classes no longer extend csObject. This is
	  not needed and it is not useful because skeleton state classes
	  are going to be moved outside the engine anyway. However, some
	  applications (like WalkTest) require the ability to attach
	  data to state objects so I extended the SCF interfaces with
	  that ability.
	- Modifed WalkTest to use the new user-data instead of the
	  csObject system.
	- Extended the iSprite3DFactoryState interface with
	  EnableSkeletalAnimation() and GetSkeleton(). Also extended
	  iSprite3DState with GetSkeletonState().
	- Also added GetFactory() to iSprite3DState.
	- Extended the iSprite3DFactoryState with various functions to access
	  the vertices, texels, normals, and triangles.
	- Added iSpriteFrame SCF interface and let csFrame implement this.
	- Added iSpriteAction SCF interface and let csSpriteAction implement
	  this.
	- Fixed the 2D sprite plugin so that the initial color table is
	  correctly copied to the real color table at initialization time
	  when lighting is disabled.
	- Changed the 2D sprite plugin so that order of SetColor() and
	  SetLighting() doesn't matter anymore.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a syntax error in irix.mak.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to document.txi:
	    - Fixed a couple factual errors.
	    - Fixed several Texinfo mark-up problems.
	    - Eliminated all of the over- and underfull `hbox' warnings
	      reported by TeX.
	    - Fixed the example @example block so that the Texinfo directives
	      are actually displayed in the output rather than being eaten by
	      the conversion process.
	    - Minor rewriting and enhancement of various topics.
	- Eric Sunshine changed the following classes so that they embed
	  particular SCF interfaces, rather than inheriting them, in order to
	  be NextStep-friendly:
	    csSkeleton                -> iSkeleton
	    csSkeletonState           -> iSkeletonState
	    csSkeletonConnection      -> iSkeletonConnection
	    csSkeletonConnectionState -> iSkeletonConnectionState
16-Jan-2001
	- Eric Sunshine changed the image-copying rule in docs.mak so that it
	  should once again work on Windows/DOS.  (It used to work, but the
	  command-line for copying images became too long, at some point, for
	  the DOS command-line input buffer.)
	- Eric Sunshine removed the broken and unuspported cygwin.mak file.
	- Martin Geisse added some hints to the docs about how to write
	  docs.
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed redefinition errors in OpenGL canvas by
	  explicitly testing for each macro before defining it. This
	  helps opengl canvas compilation on mingw32.
15-Jan-2001
	- Martin Geisse added a patch to csloader by Ed Halley.
	- Fixed a serious bug in csMeshWrapper::SetMeshObject(). This
	  function would do a DecRef() on the given mesh (possibly
	  deleting it).
	- Fixed a bug in WalkTest. It would not release the reference
	  to all created particle systems. This caused memory leaks.
	- Fixed another bug in WalkTest where the particle system was
	  created with the wrong position. Actually, it is the right position
	  but set through the wrong method. Now correctly uses
	  movable.SetPosition() to set the position.
	- Added the first and incomplete include/imspr3d.h which contains
	  the iSprite3DState and iSprite3DFactoryState SCF interfaces that
	  will be used by to access the sprite3d plugin (when it is ready).
	- Wouter Wijngaards increased the speed of skydem (and sky proc
	  texture in csfx) by making the floor simpler.
14-Jan-2001
	- Eric Sunshine fixed vfs.cfg so that it works with MacOS/X Server
	  again following Andrew's change to the meaning of CS_PLATFORM_NAME.
	- Eric Sunshine added several missing /lev/* entries to vfs.cfg.
	- Norman Kramer removed empty and svga displaydrivers for MESA.
	- Norman also did some small modifications to the OpenGL X2D canvas
	  in general:
	    - Explicit set of dispdriver to NULL.
	    - Slightly changed error message when not being able to load
	      from opengl.cfg.
	- Norman did the following changes to the OpenGL renderer:
	    - Enabled the perspective patch in DrawPolygonFX (although its
	      a slowdown i'd rather trade that for a correctly mapped
	      texture).
	    - Perspective patch expected 1/z instead of z as the 3rd
	      coo-value. Since this seemed not consistent with software
	      renderer i changed it to expect a plain z-value.
13-Jan-2001
	- Wyatt Miler did some minor Mac project file adjustment and updated
	  for the new mesh object plugins.
12-Jan-2001
	- Eric Sunshine fixed several bugs in soundraw.cpp where it was
	  applying `delete[]' to a void*.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the makefiles for vsh and vfstest so that they
	  link with the VFS plugin when built `statically'.  These broke for
	  static builds when VFS was moved into its own plug-in module.
	- Wouter Wijngaards added a method to csmeshwrapper to get a
	  pointer to the mesh back again.
	- Wouter also updated win32/directdetection.h to make it
	  backwards compatible to dx3 define. It should compile fine now
	  for dx8. (Also it still compiles fine with older dx versions).
	- Wouter made similar changes in the make install target as the
	  changes in docs from htm to html. The make install target
	  should work once more.
11-Jan-2001
	- Wyatt Miler updated the Macintosh project files.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the project:
	    - Renamed the following project directories:
		CS/plugins/meshldr --> CS/plugins/mesh/loader
		CS/plugins/meshobj --> CS/plugins/mesh/object
	    - Renamed the following SCF class names, prefixes, and suffixes:
		crystalspace.meshldr --> crystalspace.mesh.loader
		crystalspace.meshldr.ZZZfact
		                     --> crystalspace.mesh.loader.factory.ZZZ
		crystalspace.meshobj --> crystalspace.mesh.object
		crystalspace...explo --> crystalspace...explosion
		crystalspace...fount --> crystalspace...fountain
		crystalspace...spr2d --> crystalspace...sprite.2d
	    - Fixed all makefiles, source files, header files, documentation,
	      and `world' files to account for the directory and SCF class name
	      changes.
	- Eric Sunshine moved selection of the software renderer for PLUGINS
	  out of the platform-specific makefiles (CS/libs/cssys/*.mak) and
	  into CS/mk/user.mak since it is not specific to any particular
	  platform.
10-Jan-2001
	- Martin Geisse fixed some minor naming and comment flaws in the
	  idungeon interface file.
	- Martin changed the win32 docs: grouped msvc5 stuff in one section and
	  added a FAQ entry.
	- Martin also committed a patch to win32.cpp from Ed Halley.
	- Martin added some information to the procedural texture docs and
	  added better explanation of the Print() function of the 2D and 3D
	  video driver.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a typo in win32.txi and made several other minor
	  changes.
	- Eric Sunshine changed the file extension on the HTML files in the
	  docs/html and docs/pubapi directories from .htm to .html at Andrew's
	  insistence.  :-)
	- Eric Sunshine lowered the verbosity level of the build process for
	  the HTML version of the User's Manual (make htmldoc).
	- Andrew Zabolotny fixed qsqrt() so that both binutils 2.9.1 and 2.9.5
	  assemble it exactly the same way.
9-Jan-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed a compile warning in WalkTest.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a problem in bmpimage.cpp which caused loading
	  of BMP files on big-endian Solaris to fail.
	- Andrew Zabolotny made the following changes:
	    - Started implementing "hints" at startup.  Actually just wrote a
	      number of them in MazeD.zip::hints.cfg
	    - I decided to change a little the ideology of MazeD.  The
	      ex-"Draft View" will be split now into two different kinds of
	      windows: Model Editors and World Editors.  In Model Editor you
	      will edit models (rooms, things, sprites) and in the World Editor
	      you will place them (without being able to change the models
	      itselves).  mzDraftView component is the common ancestor now for
	      both mzModelEditor and mzWorldEditor components, and can draw the
	      coordinate axis and grid, nothing mode.  The split between
	      DraftView and ModelEditor is finished.
	    - Created the mzWorldEditor window.  It doesn't do much yet, but
	      already has basic functionality.  As the world is loaded, the
	      rooms are "centered" around origin, and a respective
	      mzModelInstance with the respective translation transform is set
	      up.  This allow to edit every room as if it is located in the
	      origin, which is easier.
	    - Fixed a bug recently introduced by somebody.  For software
	      renderer iTextureHandle::Prepare() did no remap_texture() which
	      results in NULL palette->global palette conversion table.  This
	      means you cannot use texture after you do Prepare, but can if you
	      do PrepareAllTextures().  Or alternatively you can call Prepare()
	      then SetGamma() :-) In short, a mess.
	    - Fixed a lot of bugs in fullscreen switching logic for all three
	      X11 canvas plug-ins (x2d, linex2d, glx2d):
		- Moved all the code relevant to fullscreen switching to two
		  files, x2dfs.h and x2dfs.inc for easier maintainance.  All
		  three X11 plugins include them from the relevant .h and .cpp
		  files.
		- Fixed a bug: when a fullscreen mode not matching current
		  canvas size is not available, the canvas may be cleared,
		  which is not desirable.
		- Bug: when current XFree86 videomode is the "best match"
		  videomode for the current canvas size, the canvas driver
		  would hang (loop forever in XWaitEvent).
		- Bug: If videomode does not match canvas size, and canvas
		  resizing is allowed, the canvas size will be adjusted to
		  match videomode.  It was supposed to work before but it
		  didn't.  If canvas resizing is not allowed, the canvas is not
		  resized, but centered instead.
		- Bug: If an unexpected ConfigureNotify would arrive to our
		  window, canvas may be suddenly resized to an erroneous size.
		  I've added a check for ConfigureNotify to be related to our
		  window.
	    - Re-implemented "model instances" in MazeD to allow arbitrary
	      hierarchical structures.  For now the top level of the hierarchy
	      can contain only rooms, although this is not a MazeD limit, it is
	      a engine limit.  Each instance has its move vector and space warp
	      matrix, which are relative to parent object.  Moving/rotating
	      parent object will move/rotate child objects as well.  Model
	      instance position and warp are stored either as a MOVE(), or a
	      HARDMOVE() statement (for rooms and for instances that have the
	      "LockedPos" flag set).  Alas, for now engine doesn't allow rooms
	      at any level other than top level, maybe it makes sense to remove
	      this limitation.  For example, a castle (which would be a room)
	      would contain a hall (child room of castle) which contains
	      something even smaller (child of hall).  Also for now we don't
	      have sector templates, which is bad again (if you duplicate a
	      room multiple times, you'll get it multiple times in output,
	      although it could be avoided).
	- Eric Sunshine fixed several compilation problems in MazeD following
	  Andrew's changes.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a long-standing bug in archive.cpp where
	  csArchive::ArchiveEntry::FreeBuffer() was clobbering the
	  uncompressed-size value.  The bad side-effect of this was that if an
	  attempt was made to re-read the entry's contents later on, the read
	  operation would mysteriously return zero bytes.  This particular
	  problem was often triggered during caching of PVS and Octree data
	  structures.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a bug in the Octree caching code where, in one
	  circumstance, the `write' routine would emit more data than the
	  `read' routine was expecting; with the result that the data stream
	  would become unsynchronized.
	- Eric Sunshine made csPolygonTree's ReadString(), ReadBox3(),
	  ReadVector3(), ReadPlane3(), ReadLong(), ReadUShort(), ReadByte(),
	  and ReadBool() methods more robust by checking for VFS read errors
	  and returning somewhat sensible values rather than returning complete
	  garbage values.
8-Jan-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed procedural sky for OpenGL.
	- Wouter also optimized it a little to use the new qsqrt().
	- Made some initial documentation on the MeshObject system.  Not
	  finished but already useful.  Check it out in
	  docs/texinfo/plugins/meshobj.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the Mesh Object
	  documentation which Jorrit wrote:
	    - Fixed a bunch of Texinfo mark-up errors and problems.
	    - Normalized mark-up and typographical usage to be consistent with
	      other idioms established throughout the manual.
	    - Corrected several typographical and gramatical problems.
	    - Eliminated a bunch of over- and underfull `hbox' errors reported
	      by TeX.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the project:
	    - Added appropriate PIXEL_PREPROC() and PIXEL_POSTPROC()
	      invocations to scanalph.inc in the software renderer so that
	      these functions operate in the same manner as all other functions
	      which take PIXEL_PREPROC() and PIXEL_POSTPROC() into account.
	    - Entirely eliminated the TOP8BITS_R8G8B8_USED flag/mode from the
	      software renderer.  There were several problems with this `patch'
	      which was supposed to handle the case where some of the RGB pixel
	      data occupied the top-byte of the 32-bit pixel:
		o It was fragile.  Each time someone modified or added code to
	          the software renderer, that code had to be checked for
	          breakage.  If broken, then such code had to be fixed.
		o It was difficult and time-consuming to fix these problems.
	          Often, the affected code was spread about in several areas of
	          the renderer.
		o It coupled the software renderer far too tightly to the 2D
	          driver by hardcoding the pixel layout of the 2D driver into
	          the 3D renderer.  (This occurred in pixtype.inc.)  This made
	          it impossible to use an alternate 2D driver with different
	          pixel layout.
	    - Removed the `pixel adjust' value from the software renderer.
	      This was used as part of the TOP8BITS_R8G8B8_USED mechanism.
	    - Note that even though the TOP8BITS_R8G8B8_USED mechanism was
	      removed, I left all of the invocations of PIXEL_PREPROC() and
	      PIXEL_POSTPROC() in place for posterity since they illustrate
	      every place in the renderer where one must take special care to
	      correctly deal with the hard-coded assumptions about pixel
	      layout.  These two macros have been relocated (from various
	      files) to a new master location in scan.h where they are provided
	      with empty definitions.
	    - The default Apple/NeXT 2D driver now post-processes the 32-bit
	      RGB data delivered by the software renderer by re-arranging it
	      into a secondary frame buffer.  This change was necessary for the
	      following reasons:
		o The fragile TOP8BITS_R8G8B8_USED mechanism was removed in
	          order to decouple the 3D renderer from the 2D driver.
		o Without the TOP8BITS_R8G8B8_USED mechanism, the software
	          renderer is hardcoded (for performance reasons) to produce
	          pixel data in a particular format (ARGB on little-endian, and
	          ABGR on big-endian)
		o The pixel data generated by the software renderer is
	          unsuitable for default the Apple/NeXT 2D driver which expects
	          the layout to be ABGR on little-endian and RGBA on
	          big-endian.  (This is a limitation of the AppKit, which is
	          what the default 2D driver is based upon.)
	    - Removed the apparently unused RED_PREPROC() macro from
	      haloscan.inc.
	    - Fixed several copy/paste bugs in csLightMap::ReadFromCache().
	    - Fixed a problem where `make depend' failed on Apple/NeXT when
	      configured for multiple architectures via the TARGET_ARCHS
	      makefile variable.  (Specifically, the compiler could not grok
	      use of -MM with multiple -arch flags.)
	    - Disabled the `quick' versions of QRound() and QInt() on M68K for
	      NeXT.  Even though these methods work correctly on NeXT M68K in
	      general, there were some cases where the compiler botched their
	      invocations and generated incorrect results.
	    - Disabled the new `quick' square-root (in qsqrt.h) for NeXT since
	      the compiler can not grok the contained assembly.
	    - Renamed the preprocessor flag NO_QSQRT to CS_NO_QSQRT.
	    - Fixed a minor problem in -[NeXTDelegate localize:toView:x:y:]
	      where the conversion of the mouse's Y-coordinate was off by one.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the QUERY_PLUGIN() macros in isystem.h so that it
	  is possible to call them as QUERY_PLUGIN(&object, iBlah) rather than
	  having to resort to the ugly QUERY_PLUGIN((&object), iBlah).
	- Eric Sunshine fixed vfstest.cpp so that it no longer instantiates
	  the VFS plug-in twice.
	- Eric Sunshine changed all of the platform-specific makefiles so that
	  they consistently use LIBS.SOCKET.SYSTEM to specify the Socket
	  library.  Eliminated the old, unix-specific NEED_SOCKET_LIB flag.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed problems in socket.mak where it did not link with
	  the correct libraries when static linking was used.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the platform-specific makefiles so that they
	  consistently use the makefile variables CFLAGS.D, CFLAGS.I, LFLAGS.L,
	  and LFLAGS.l.
7-Jan-2001
	- Made usage of qisqrt() more sensible. First test if square
	  is less than some amount then you don't have to do the entire
	  qisqrt().
	- By making use of the new qisqrt() I optimized csCamera::LookAt()
	  a little more.
6-Jan-2001
	- Created snow and rain mesh object plugins (for the snow and rain
	  particle systems).
	- Created iSnowState and iRainState interfaces to access these plugins.
	- Modified WalkTest to use the new snow and rain plugins instead of
	  the old particle systems in csfx.
	- Finished the snow and rain loader plugins.
	- Moved spiral particle system to plugin. Note that this particle
	  system currently crashes. Also created the loader and modified
	  WalkTest.
	- Removed native support for loading particle systems in csloader.
	  Particle systems are now loaded through the new MESHOBJ keyword
	  and the plugins. This means that the flarge.zip you can find
	  on the CS site will no longer work. I will soon put a replacement
	  there.
	- Removed dependency on CSFX library from most apps (all except
	  simple) since the loader no longer depends on csfx itself.
	- Removed particle support from csengine. All particles have now
	  moved to plugins.
	- Fixed the new qsqrt and qisqrt from Andrew. It appears that it
	  was returning the negative square root. I negated the result.
	  I modified several places in csengine and csgeom where either
	  FastSqrt (the old one) and normal sqrt were used and replaced it
	  with qsqrt() and qisqrt(). All seems to work well but in case
	  something bad happens I added a define NO_QSQRT to include/qsqrt.h.
	  If you enable this define the fast versions of qsqrt will not be
	  used. I'd like to be notified of this if there are problems.
	- Made a new ball plugin just for demonstration purposes and also
	  because it is a very efficient way to make a ball :-)
	  Extended simple application to show such a ball with a plasma
	  texture on top of it (just turn around to see it). It looks
	  really nice :-)
	- Philip Wyett fixed several compile errors in demosky.
	- Philip also fixed the ddraw canvas to actually open windowed
	  when it is told to.
5-Jan-2001
	- Wouter Wijngaards Added a procedural skybox texture.
	  And a demoing program (ala simple) to show it. 'demosky'.
	  the bottom half of the skybox is filled with a mock watery splotch,
	  the top half with clouds and a sunlighted spot.
	- Wouter Wijngaards says: From Harald Fielker
	  (fielker@informatik.fh-augsburg.de) I got an addition to csloader,
	  a LoadThing and LoadThingTemplate methods. You can load a thing
	  from a vfs file with them.
	- Norman Kramer replaced AdvanceSpriteFrames with engines NextFrame
	  for cctest.
	- Fixed a big initialization bug in the spr2d plugin. This would
	  cause strange and hard to debug crashes sometimes.
	- Fixed a very similar initialization bug in the fountain and
	  explosion plugins.
	- Fixed another bug in the general particle code for the particle
	  plugins. Particles were DecRef()'ed once too many.
	- Fixed csMeshWrapper::NextFrame() so that it also calls NextFrame
	  on the children.
	- csSprite no longer implements iParticle. In the future it will
	  be the mesh objects themselves that implement iParticle. At this
	  moment however, it means that only the 2D sprite mesh objects
	  work as particles (which is fine since these are actually the
	  only objects that are really useful as particles).
	- Also removed csSprite::AddColor() and SetColor() since they
	  were actually only ment for the particle systems. Moved AddColor()
	  and SetColor() as specific functions for csSprite3D.
	- Moved implementation of csSprite::Rotate() and ScaleBy() to
	  csSprite and made non virtual. The implementation was the same
	  for all subclasses anyway.
	- Changed iParticle interface to make it possible to use relative
	  transforms for particle systems. The transform of the parent
	  particle system is given with Draw() and UpdateLighting().
	  SetPosition() should now be specified in the particle system
	  coordinate system.
	- The particle system plugins now render correctly in a hierarchical
	  transformation context. This gives really very nice effects.
	  For example, I put a fountain particle system on the hand of the
	  robot (which is rotating). This looks as if the robot is shooting
	  around with fountain particles.
	- Finished the explosion particle system loader plugins.
	- Started working on the fire particle system (in
	  plugins/meshobj/fire).
	- Added iFireState interface for the fire plugin system.
	- Finished the fire plugin and changed WalkTest to use it instead
	  of the old version in csfx.
	- Finished the fire loader plugins.
	- Implemented MIXMODE command in all mesh object loader plugins.
4-Jan-2001
	- Martin Geisse moved volume control from the sound drivers to
	  the software sound renderer. Also cleaned up the wave-out driver
	  a bit.
	- Andrew Zabolotny fixed the disaster caused to VFS by one of
	  Eric's changes. CS_PLATFORM_NAME was not the strict name of
	  platform like it should be, but rather a free-form description
	  of the platform, which is wrong.
	- The sprited2D plugin now also implements iParticle which means
	  it can be directly used as a particle for the particle systems.
	- The particle systems now use the sprite2d plugin directly instead
	  of using csSprite2D.
	- As a consequence of this I'm now able to remove csSprite2D
	  from the engine. In addition I also removed support for loading
	  2D sprites directly. Instead the new MESHOBJ token should be used.
	- Forgot to implement support for the MATERIAL keyword in the
	  sprite2d loader (the factory loader did support it).
	- Started work on moving particle systems to plugins. There is
	  now a directory plugins/meshobj/partgen which contains the
	  general classes for particle systems (csParticleSystem
	  and csNewtonianParticleSystem).
	- Added iParticleState interface which represents the general
	  settings common to all particle systems. csParticleSystem
	  implements this.
	- Started moving fountain particle system to plugins. Source can
	  be found in plugins/meshobj/fountain.
	- Added iFountainState interface which represents the general
	  settings specific for the fountain. csFountainParticleSystem
	  implements this.
	- Fixed SCF macros for csPolygonSet, csSprite, csSkeletonLimbState
	  and csPolygon3D. They were all using IMPLEMENT_IBASE_EXT
	  but forgot to close this with IMPLEMENT_IBASE_EXT_END (instead
	  they used the default IMPLEMENT_IBASE_END).
	- Added NextFrame to csSprite and implement this in all the
	  current remaining subclasses (csParticleSystem, csMeshWrapper,
	  and csSprite3D).
	- Added similar NextFrame() to iMeshObject.
	- Added empty implementation of NextFrame() to cube and 2D sprite
	  plugins. They don't have animation so they don't need a NextFrame().
	- Added a functional implementation of NextFrame() to the general
	  particle system plugin code.
	- Renamed csEngine::AdvanceSpriteFrames() to NextFrame(). In
	  addition it will now also control animation and deletion of
	  particle systems.
	- Removed UpdateParticleSystems() because csEngine::NextFrame()
	  does this.
	- Finished the fountain plugin. The fountain plugin itself uses
	  the 2D sprite plugin to create the fountain particles.
	- Added WantToDie() to iMeshObject. With this function a mesh
	  can indicate that it wants to die. This is most useful for particle
	  systems that have only a limited time to live (like an explosion).
	- Also added default WantToDie() to csSprite and implemented it
	  in csMeshWrapper by asking the mesh. By doing this the auto-delete
	  system of particle systems is generalized to all mesh objects.
	- Started moving explosion particle system to plugins. Source can
	  be found in plugins/meshobj/explo.
	- Added iExplosionState interface which represents the general
	  settings specific for the explosion. csExploParticleSystem
	  implements this.
	- Added iDynLight SCF interface for dynamic lights. This is needed
	  for the explosion plugin.
	- Extended iLight SCF interface with SetColor() and SetSector().
	- Extended iEngine with CreateDynLight() and RemoveDynLight().
	- Finished the explosion plugin. Note that there still seems to be
	  a bug with lighting and the particles of the particle systems.
	  Sometimes the lighting routine on the particle system is not
	  called (UpdateLighting).
	- Changed walktest to use the fountain and explosion plugins instead
	  of the still existing fountain particle systems in csfx.
	- Fixed a CSFX dependency error in the blocks makefile.
	- Implemented the fountain loader plugin (in plugins/meshldr/fountain).
3-Jan-2001
	- Andrew Zabolotny did the following changes to CS:
	    - Enhanced a little software DrawPixmap for
	      textures-with-alphamap, where in 16 and 8 bpp modes alpha=0
	      still would lead to a changing background a little.
	    - Added a nice logo to MazeD's About box.
	    - Fixed a few things here and there in MazeD.
	    - A new QInt and QRound that will work on some big-endian CPUs
	      as well.
	    - Fix to slow QRound so that it works correctly for negative
	      numbers.
	    - A new fast sqrt() and 1/sqrt() implementation. Not used
	      anywhere for now (I'll leave this on Jorrit's behalf) but it
	      has a big potential. Engine is using 1/sqrt() in a lot of
	      places, and computing 1/sqrt() in one go is a big win. Plain
	      sqrt() is about 31% faster (on PII and Celeron) than FPU's
	      FSQRT instruction, and 1/sqrt() is 38% faster than FSQRT
	      (dunno how fast than actually computing 1/sqrt(x) - division
	      is quite a slow operation, almost as slow as sqrt itself - 42
	      and 71 clocks respectively).
	- Wouter Wijngaards improved the portal more. It has a border around
	  the portal polygon, showing a part of the portal texture mapped
	  on it.
	- Added GetObjectBoundingBox() to iMeshObject.
	  Added implementation for this method to the cube plugin.
	- Implemented UpdateInPolygonTrees() in csMeshWrapper so that
	  mesh objects will now correctly be drawn in BSP type levels too.
	- Implemented csMeshWrapper::Rotate().
	- Started porting csSprite2D (2D sprites) to the new mesh
	  plugin system. Created new directory plugins/meshobj/spr2d
	  where it will be located.
	- Also created iSprite2DFactoryState SCF interface which will
	  be used to set the characteristics of 2D sprite factories. Also
	  added iSprite2DState to set the characteristics of 2D sprite
	  instances.
	- Renamed iCubeMeshObject to iCubeFactoryState because I think this
	  is a better name which also fits the name of the 2D sprite
	  state interfaces better.
	- Also created the 2D sprite loaders.
	- Plugin 2D sprites are now working mostly. The old 2D sprites are not
	  yet removed because the particle systems still depend on them.
	- Extended iMovable and csMovable with GetFullPosition() which returns
	  the position of the movable but keeps track of the hierarchical
	  transformations (similar to GetFullTransform()).
	- Fixed a serious bug in csloader with regards to the new plugin
	  loaders. The wrong type plugin was taken in some cases.
	- Removed MoveToSector from iParticle. It is not needed and wrong
	  if used in combination with the new mesh object system (they have no
	  notion of sectors).
	- Removed DeferUpdateLighting() from iParticle.
	- Changed iParticle::UpdateLighting() to take an array of iLight
	  instead of csLight. SCF classes should not refer to engine classes.
	- Changed iParticle::Draw() to use iRenderView instead of csRenderView.
	- Added iLight::GetPrivateObject() and iRenderView::GetPrivateObject().
2-Jan-2001
	- Philip Wyett fixed a small VC compiler warning.
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed a compile warning.
	- Completed a fix Eric Sunshine did (previous millenium) with regards
	  to CalculateFogMesh. Eric missed a tiny detail. Oops! :-)
	- Added an extra level of abstraction in the mesh object system.
	  Created a plugin called iMeshObjectType which represents a type
	  of mesh objects. From this you can created instances of
	  iMeshObjectFactory. So iMeshObjectFactory is no longer a plugin
	  but instances have to be created through iMeshObjectType.
	- Added csCubeMeshObjectType in the cube plugin to implement
	  iMeshObjectType.
	- Added new QueryPlugIn to iSystem and system.h with which you can
	  query for a loaded plugin on class ID. This complements the two
	  other existing QueryPlugIn functions which could look for Func ID
	  and interface name. The reason for this function is that you
	  sometimes want to load a plugin with a certain class ID but you
	  only want one. If there already is one you reuse the previously
	  loaded plugin instance. So in that case you do QUERY_PLUGIN_CLASS
	  first and if that fails (returns NULL) you do LOAD_PLUGIN.
	- Also added QUERY_PLUGIN_CLASS which will use the new QueryPlugIn.
	- Added GetNumPlugIns() and GetPlugIn() to iSystem and system.h.
	  With this you can query the list of currently loaded plugins in
	  the system.
	- Fixed a bug in csloader which would cause the loader plugins to
	  be loaded multiple times instead of only once.
	- csCubeMeshObjectType now also implements iConfig through embedding.
	  Using this you can set the default size (x, y, and z) and the default
	  shift (x, y, and z) for all factories created from this object
	  mesh type.
	- Added 'plugins' console command to WalkTest with which you can
	  ask all loaded plugins (loaded into the system driver).
	- Added 'conflist' console command to WalkTest with which you can
	  ask all config options for some loaded plugin (use the 'plugins'
	  command to get the list of plugins). You also get the current values
	  of the options. For example 'conflist 3' will list all the config
	  options and values for the plugin with number 3 (from the list
	  given by 'plugins').
	- Added 'confset' console command to WalkTest with which you can
	  set a config option to some value. Arguments are <plugnr>,<name>,<val>
	  with <plugnr> the number you get from the 'plugins' command.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a compilation warning from walkcmd.cpp.
1-Jan-2001
	- Added 'children' array to csMeshWrapper. By this we will support
	  hierarchical objects and transformations.
	- Added support for MESHOBJ keyword in MESHOBJ. This will be used
	  to specify the hierarchical objects. i.e. the mesh objects can
	  be children of a parent mesh object. The transformation specified
	  in the children is relative to the parent position and orientation.
	- Generalized csRotatingObject in the entity system of WalkTest
	  so that it will now also be able to rotate sprites instead of
	  only things (sprites in the general sense: csSprite, so the new
	  plugin objects are also included).
	- Added support for KEY keyword in MESHOBJ.
	- Modified WalkTest so that it will also recognize the children
	  of csMeshWrapper and parse the KEY statements for them.
	- Changed iCubeMeshObject to make it more general. You can now
	  specify the sizes for x, y, and z seperatelly. So the cube does
	  not have to be a cube anymore :-)
	- Also added shift values so that you can shift the (0,0,0) point
	  of the cube to another place.
	- Fixed a bad bug with UpdateLighting for the cube plugin. In some
	  cases it would actually crash because UpdateLighting was called
	  before the cube object was properly initialized. Added SetupObject()
  	  function to initialize cube properly and if needed.
	- Hierarchical objects are now working :-)
31-Dec-2000
	- Eric Sunshine fixed compilation warnings in engine.cpp, rview.cpp,
	  meshobj.cpp, prdots.cpp, prfire.cpp, proctex.cpp, cubeldr.cpp, and
	  cube.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a bizarre bug in csRenderView's
	  CalculateFogMesh() where a local `fog_info' variable was incorrectly
	  initialized.  (There is no way that this code could have ever worked
	  correctly prior to being repaired.)
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a bug in cspython.mak where it would potentially
	  try to compile cs_pyth.cpp twice.
	- Eric Sunshine modified the Python plug-in makefile so that
	  compilation warnings are disabled for the Swig-generated cs_pyth.cpp
	  source file.  This was done since cs_pyth.cpp is known to spew many
	  compilation warnings, yet because it is auto-generated, it is out of
	  our control to eliminate the warnings.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the broken `linex2dclean' makefile target.
30-Dec-2000
	- Philip Wyett fixed some of the 3D renderers that Jorrit forgot
	  to fix yesterday.
	- Got two nice textures from Wouter Wijngaards to use for the
	  'portal' console command. The textures are in standard.zip.
	  Only the texture for the box of the portal is used for now.
	  There are some technical problems to getting the other texture
	  working correctly.
	- Added iLoaderPlugIn interface. A mesh object plugin (or something
	  else, it is general enough) can implement this in order to
	  provide extra loading functionality for the loader.
	- Renamed csMeshObject to csMeshWrapper in order not to let people
	  think that csMeshWrapper actually implements iMeshObject
	  (it does not).
	- Added csMeshFactoryWrapper which is a class similar to what
	  csSpriteTemplate is for sprites.
	- Added iMeshFactoryWrapper and let csMeshFactoryWrapper implement
	  this through embedding.
	- Extended iEngine and csEngine with FindMeshFactory().
	- Extended iRegion and csRegion with FindMeshFactory() and extended
	  csRegion to actually support mesh object factories as well.
	- Added new array of mesh object factories in csEngine
	  (meshobj_factories).
	- Implemented cube loader plugins. One for cube factories and one
	  for regular cubes. These plugins are placed in plugins/meshldr/cube.
	- Added support for MESHOBJ keyword in WORLD (loader). This will
	  generate a general csMeshWrapper object for the specified
	  plugin. For example, to load an instance of the cube factory
	  in the world you can do:
	  	MESHOBJ 'cubeFact' (
		    PLUGIN ('crystalspace.meshldr.cubefact')
		    PARAMS (
		        MATERIAL ('stone')
			SIZE (.5)
		    )
		)
	  The section in the 'PARAMS' block will be passed to the plugin
	  loader.
	- Added support for MESHOBJ keyword in SECTOR or ROOM. This is
	  based on the factory above:
	  	MESHOBJ 'cube1' (
		    PLUGIN ('crystalspace.meshldr.cube')
		    PARAMS (
		        FACTORY ('cubeFact')
		    )
		    MOVE (V (-4,0,9))
		)
	- Fixed some of the FindXxx() routines in csEngine so that they
	  actually return NULL if the object is not found instead of
	  some low (but invalid) value.
29-Dec-2000
	- Added iRenderView::ClipBBox() to test if a screen bounding box
	  is visible and needs to be clipped. In addition it does far plane
	  clipping. Thus it provides a quick and easy way for a mesh object
	  plugin to test if some object is visible and needs to be clipped.
	  The code is a straight copy from the code that was in csSprite3D.
	  csSprite3D now also uses this function.
	- Made iClipper2D and csClipper::ClassifyBox use a 'const' parameter.
	- Cube also uses clipping correctly now.
	- Extended iMeshObject with DrawTest() and UpdateLighting().
	  DrawTest() is the first part of Draw() which is responsible for
	  testing quick visibility. Draw() will do the real work. In between
	  UpdateLighting() can optionally be called.
	- Added IsMirrored() to iCamera.
	- Fixed the Python plugin for the change of GetAspect() to GetFOV().
	- Changed iGraphics3D::GetObjectToCamera() so that it returns a
	  reference to the transformation. Modified all the 3D drivers
	  accordingly.
	- Extended iLight SCF structure to make it useful for calculating
	  lighting in the cube plugin.
	- Changed csLight to let it implement iLight through embedding
	  instead of inheritance.
	- Fixed UpdateLighting() for csMeshObject.
	- Added SetMixMode() and GetMixMode() to iCubeMeshObject interface.
	- Did some cleanup to various of the SCF include files (comments
	  and CS code style).
	- All the above changes accomplish the following for the cube plugin:
	    - Lighting works now (similarly to how sprite lighting works but
	      a bit simpler).
	    - Cube will be correctly rendered through a mirror.
	    - Changed Simple so that the new cube moves around at the
	      same rate as the dynamic light at the top of the room.
	      That way you can see how the lighting is dynamically updated.
	    - Cube now uses the plasma procedural texture.
	    - Cube is now drawn with CS_FX_ADD mixmode for a nice blending
	      effect. This does not work correctly in software mode though
	      because there is a bug with blending and procedural textures.
	      The initialization of the procedural textures (which are
	      8-bit textures) overwrites the blend tables for the 16/32-bit
	      render mode as well.
28-Dec-2000
	- Philip Wyett made a small fix to the cube plugin header.
	- Seth Galbraith added more error checking to the MD2 importer.
	- Added Visit() to iMaterialWrapper.
	- Cube plugin now renders using DrawTriangleMesh().
	- Added CalculateFogMesh() and CalculateFogPolygon() to iRenderView.
	  Mesh object plugins can call this function to update the fog
	  information in the mesh or poly object. Removed the badly
	  placed same functions from pol2d.cpp.
	- Cube plugin now supports fog.
	- Added iTransformationManager SCF interface for the transformation
	  manager. Only contains GetCookie() function at the moment.
	  csTransformationManager implements this interface through
	  embedding.
	- Added iEngine::GetTransformationManager().
	- Added iRenderView::GetEngine().
27-Dec-2000
	- Added iCubeMeshObject interface. The cube plugin implements
	  this interface in addition to iMeshObjectFactory. Using
	  iCubeMeshObject you can specify the geometric constraints
	  and appearance of the cube (size and texture). Every mesh object
	  plugin will have such a companion interface to specify appearance.
	- Added GetMaterialHandle() to iMaterialWrapper interface.
	- Extended Draw() in iMeshObject with an iMovable parameter.
	- Added GetTransform() in iCamera.
	- Made QUERY_INTERFACE macro a wee bit safer.
	- Fixed a bug in csCamera. One of the constructors didn't properly
	  initialize the SCF stuff for iCamera. Also changed csCamera
	  so that iCamera is now implemented through embedding instead
	  of inheritance.
	- Changed GetAspect() and GetInvAspect() to GetFOV() and GetInvFOV()
	  in iCamera.
	- Added GetShiftX() and GetShiftY() to iCamera.
	- Fixed the SCF stuff for csRenderView. It was not properly done
	  given that csCamera itself implements iBase.
	- Continued work on csCubeMesh plugin so that it now renders a
	  wireframe version.
26-Dec-2000
	- Samuel Humphreys did the following:
	    - Little clean up of ptlab.
	    - Fixed procedural textures after AndyZ's recent changes.
	    - Removed Jorrit's additional PrepareTextures() from protex3d.cpp.
	    - Fixed Simple to display procedural textures properly with the
	      global palette properly communicated.
	    - Cleaned up csphyzik library file formatting.
	- csParser no longer deletes all textures and materials in the
	  MATERIALS and TEXTURES statement. This caused bad crashes with the
	  portal command. The portal command is now working properly again.
	- Added iRenderView and let csRenderView implement this through
	  embedding.
	- Added iClipper2D and let csClipper implement this through
	  inheritance.
	- Removed csClipper::IsInside(x,y) so that only the csVector2 version
	  remains.
	- Renamed the in-place clipper from 'Clip' to 'ClipInPlace' to avoid
	  C++ inheritance clashes.
	- Added iMeshObject interface which will eventually be used
	  to move sprites, and particle systems outside the engine as plugins.
	- Additionally added iMeshObjectFactory plugin. This is a plugin
	  that can be loaded in the engine will generate instances of
	  one type of mesh object.
	- Added csCubeMeshObject as a plugin (in plugins/meshobj/cube) which
	  represents a simple cube that is going to be used as a test-base
	  for the new iMeshObject system. Only when csCubeMeshObject is
	  working properly; I am going to port csSprite3D and csParticleSystem
	  to iMeshObject.
	- Added csMeshObject which is the engine's implementation of
	  iMeshObject. csMeshObject is eventually going to replace csSprite.
	  It will controll all aspects of mesh objects which are global and
	  pass them on to the various implementations of iMeshObject.
	- Added code to Simple to query this new cube plugin.
25-Dec-2000
	- Norman Kramer changed csPixmap so that it calls IncRef() and
	  DecRef() on the contained iTextureHandle.  He states that he came
	  across this issue when someone added an `engine->StartEngine()'
	  invocation to LoadMapFile(); all his pixmaps that held
	  iTextureHandles created via LoadTexture() before LoadMapFile() was
	  invoked became invalid.
24-Dec-2000
	- Norman Kramer added CSFX lib to several of the makefiles.
	- Eric Sunshine made a slight modification to handling of the Backspace
	  key in the OpenStep port so that it works in the expected fashion in
	  Crystal Space.
	- Eric Sunshine added documentation for the `walkall' makefile target
	  to the output of the `help' makefile target.
23-Dec-2000
	- Norman Kramer fixed a bug in the bmp loader.
	- Moved snow, rain, spiral, fountain, fire, and explosion particle
	  systems from csengine to csfx library. Only the basic particle
	  and newtonian particle systems remain in csengine.
	- Found out that materials and textures were not correctly searched
	  in the current region. Fixed csloader for this.
	- Fixed a potential bug with polygons that had no texture. The
	  new Visit() would crash on them. It seems however that there is
	  still a bug somewhere. The portal command is very unreliable now.
	  To be investigated.
	- Extended csLoader::FindMaterial() with a regionOnly parameter.
	- Added csEngine::FindCsTexture() and FindCsMaterial() which return
	  a csTextureHandle and csMaterialHandle respectively.
22-Dec-2000
	- Eliminated a bug in the procedural texture manager for the software
	  renderer.  The problem was that only the first 8-bit proc texture was
	  correctly initialized.
	- Fixed csfx so that there is only one Initialize() method now as was
	  originally intended.
	- Disabled lighting for the fire and water polygons that are created in
	  simple.  Now fire and water will actually look like fire and water
	  without having a green tint (from the nearby green light).
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the project:
	    - Upgraded the NextStep port of Crystal Space to be fully
	      compatible with Andrew's National Keyboard Support.  Implementing
	      this required reverse engineering internal NextStep data
	      structures and writing code to extract the appropriate
	      information.  See the discussion in the new NeXTKeymap.cpp file
	      for a detailed explanation.  (National Keyboard Support had
	      already been enabled for the MacOS/X Server and OpenStep ports
	      several days earlier.)
	    - Fixed a long-standing problem with keyboard handling in the
	      NextStep port.  Keystrokes modified by the Alternate key were
	      never interpreted correctly by Crystal Space.  The reason for
	      this was that NextStep had already cooked the keystroke
	      completely out of recognition by the time Crystal Space had a
	      chance to see it, and there was no way to retrieve the original,
	      unmodified keystroke.  Reverse engineering the internal NeXT data
	      structures for National Keyboard Support made it possible to fix
	      this problem by making the unmodified (raw) keystroke available.
	    - Implemented F1 - F12 function key translation in the NextStep
	      port.  (These keys had already been implemented in the MacOS/X
	      Server and OpenStep ports several days earlier.)
21-Dec-2000
	- Philip Wyett fixed a small bug in texture.h.
	- Philip also found a bug in ~SoftwareCachedTexture () which
	  causes an on exit error in "appptlab" in Windows. Because of
	  possible side effects I have merely commented above the offending
	  line for resolution at a later date/more convenient time..
	  Hope that is OK.
	- Wouter Wijngaards fixed the macintosh pow() command for radiosity.
20-Dec-2000
	- Continued work on csfx library. Implemented support for a random
	  dot proc texture, plasma, fire and water (the last three are
	  taken from ptlab and were added to that application by Wouter
	  Wijngaards).
	- Added the notion of a use-callback for a csTextureWrapper.
	  This callback will be called right before a texture is used. Using
	  this callback you can make sure that procedural textures are only
	  updated when really needed (i.e. a polygon/object using the proc
	  texture is visible). Note that the callback can be called several
	  times in one frame if visible. The callback should keep this in
	  mind and use the current time to check if the callback should do
	  something.
	- Extended csTextureWrapper and csMaterialWrapper with a Visit()
	  function. The engine will call Visit() whenever the texture or
	  material is used. Visit() will call the use callback.
	- Note that this Visit() function is on csTextureWrapper and
	  not on iTextureHandle. This means that (for example) csPixmap
	  will not be able to fire this callback. If you use a procedural
	  texture on a csPixmap then you'll have to do the call to Animate
	  on your own.
	- Added GetMaterialWrapper() to csCurve.
	- Extended simple with a demo on how to use the new csfx
	  library. Added a cube with six sides demonstrating the various
	  procedural textures. Due to the new texture callback system the
	  procedural textures are only updated when needed.
	- There is currently an ugly hack in csProcTexture because there
	  seems to be a bug in the software procedural texture implementation
	  when several procedural textures are initialized from Register
	  to Prepare (i.e. interleaved Register/Prepare as opposed to first
	  doing all Register and then all Prepare). That's why there is
	  now an Initialize1 and Initialize2. If the bug is fixed this will
	  be removed.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated a compilation warning in me_matmn.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to MetaBalls:
	    - Fixed bug which prevented statistical text from displaying.  This
	      bug has existed since the beginning of time but was only
	      triggered recently.  The problem was that the `count' instance
	      variable, which plays a role in determining when statistics
	      should be displayed, was never initialized.
	    - Added default initializers for all other instance variables (in
	      addition to `count').
	    - Removed unnecessary call to csSystem::GetElapsedTime().
	    - Fixed bug: MetaSys::Help() was printing null-pointer for default
	      texture name.
	    - No longer crashes when unable to load texture.  Now prints
	      meaningful error message and exits cleanly.
19-Dec-2000
	- Andrew Zabolotny did the following changes:
	    - Fixed a error in inifile.cpp. The array allocated with
	      new[] was realloc()'ated. Now it is new/memcpy/delete'd.
	    - Fixed a minor memory leak in system driver. Event cords
	      weren't deleted at shutdown.
	    - Fixed a bad error in inifile.cpp triggered by [Macintosh]
	      section in vfs.cfg: the loader switches to base64 mode due
	      to empty assignments like:
		HOME =
	      (such lines are used to denote base64 keys) and then
	      doesn't switch back when it detects invalid base64 symbols.
	      I changed the ini loader so that it switches to base64 mode
	      by '==' statement, e.g.:
		HOME ==
		ODAwMDAwMDAgd2hpbGUKICAgIHNoYXJlZCBs
		aWJyYXJpZXMgdXN1YWxseSBoYXZlIGFkZHJl
		c3NlcyBsaWtlIDB4NHh4eHh4eHgpLgo=
		===
		;/HOME
	      If you want to assign the '=' value to a key, insert a space,
	      e.g:
		HOME = =
	      is interpreted as a normal key, not the head of a base64
	      stream. csIniFile::Save() inserts spaces automatically, thus
	      a saved ini file should read perfectly. Also if something other
	      than newline follows the second equal sign, it is also
	      interpreted as a normal key.
	    - Fixed a few memory leaks in MazeD.
	    - Finished material manager dialog. Now it is functional, use
	      Ctrl+m to invoke it, model manager has moved to Ctrl+M. Fixed
	      several bugs that leads to MazeD crashes related to materials.
	    - Fixed a bad bug in common texture manager object (txtmgr.cpp):
	      the constructor did no CONSTRUCT_IBASE.
	    - I have enhanced the memory debugger so that on Linux and OS/2
	      it is able to debug malloc/realloc/free's as well as new's and
	      delete's. There is a drawback on Linux though: it will
	      intercept all malloc/free's from all dynamic libraries (even
	      from libX11.so) thus you will see a lot of memory leaks
	      belonging to other libraries (notably libc and libX11). You can
	      filter them by address (in Linux program address is >
	      0x80000000 while shared libraries usually have addresses like
	      0x4xxxxxxx). If you want to debug memory leaks in plug-ins,
	      build executable in static link mode.
	    - Fixed a memory leak in csfont plug-in.
	    - Rearrangement of some aspects of the texture manager to simplify
	      interface API for textures and materials. Previously you had to
	      call texture manager's RegisterXXX (where XXX is Texture or
	      Material) then you had to call PrepareXXX to force texture
	      manager recompute the internal representation of the
	      texture/material; when you are done you had to call
	      UnregisterXXX. Now it works a little different: by calling
	      RegisterXXX you create a new texture/material handle, and
	      further you work only with that handle: call handle->Prepare()
  	      to prepare texture or material for usage; call handle->DecRef()
	      enough times to destroy the handle (you don't have to call
	      UnregisterXXX anymore).
	      I have fixed all the 3D renderers for this, however I'm not
	      sure about Direct3D and Glide renderers (haven't compiled
	      them). All others are fully functional.
	      You can still call PrepareTextures() and PrepareMaterials()
              on texture manager object to call Prepare on all objects at once.
	    - Renamed csTextureMMSoftware into csSoftwareTextureHandle and
	      csTextureMM into csTextureHandle for cleaner names.
	    - Before closing the system (System::Close) the engine will
	      free all texture and material handles since after closing
	      the graphics driver the handles become invalid no matter
	      whenever we did IncRef or not.
	    - Implemented alpha textures support for DrawPolygon, DrawPFX
	      and DrawPixmap in OpenGL renderer.
	    - Re-worked OpenGL texture cache. Texture unloading happens now
	      in a centralized routine, which minimizes the effort required
	      to fix any bugs in it (one of which was causing SIGSEGV on
	      exit).
	- Fixed python plugin after Andrew broke it with the changes
	  above (i.e. remove PrepareTexture() from the cs.i file).
	- Philip Wyett fixed a few compile errors in OpenGL renderer
	  after Andrew's commit.
18-Dec-2000
	- Rene Dudfield fixed a bug in sprite3d. The rand num generator
	  was not initialized.
	- Rene Dudfield also made the sprite3d lighting functions only
	  light the vertices that are used for the lod level.
	- Fixed a bug in WalkTest with ms->snd not being initialized to
	  NULL on systems that don't have sound support. This could result
	  in crashes when firing missiles.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the project:
	    - Repaired the MacOS/X Server, OpenStep, and NextStep ports of
	      Crystal Space after they had sat idle for several months.  Many
	      core-level changes to the project during the idle time broke
	      these ports rather severely.  The ports are probably about 97%
	      functional now compared to how functional they were once.  Some
	      problems still exist which will be addressed in subsequent repair
	      and upgrade sessions.  For instance, the NextStep port is not yet
	      fully compatible with Andrew's new National Keyboard Support.
	      Full compatiblity requires reverse engineering internal NextStep
	      structures.  The MacOS/X Server and OpenStep ports, on the other
	      hand, are now compatible with the National Keyboard Support.
	      Further, certain portions of the software renderer (which Andrew
	      updated since the last time I repaired all such problems) are
	      broken for the Apple/NeXT ports running at 32-bit mode on
	      big-endian hardware.  Future plans also include a port to the
	      upcoming MacOS/X, as well as further decoupling of the 2D driver
	      from the system driver.
	    - The default NeXT 2D canvas is now responsible for the querying
	      and interpreting its own `simulated depth' option.  This is no
	      longer the responsibility of the system driver.
	    - Eliminated iNeXTSystemDriver (NeXTSystemInterface.h) which
	      published a method to report the simulated-depth value to the 2D
	      canvas.  The canvas is now entirely responsible for this feature,
	      so the system driver need not publish this any longer.
	    - NeXTSystemDriver now manages an iEventOutlet which the 2D canvas
	      can use for default handling of mouse and keyboard events.
	    - NeXTSystemDriver now implements SystemExtension() to provide
	      default mouse and keyboard event handling on behalf of canvases,
	      as well as other functionality.
	    - Promoted the ability to suspend the engine's virtual-time clock
	      into csSystemDriver from NeXTSystemDriver where this feature was
	      originally implemented.  This is useful for ports which allow the
	      user to suspend the entire engine (for instance, to be friendly
	      on multi-tasking systems).  Suspending the virtual-time clock
	      prevents temporal anomalies from occurring within the engine even
	      though the real-time clock continues to elapse.  An example of a
	      temporal anomaly would be the firing of a missile just prior to
	      suspension of the engine.  Upon engine resumption, if the
	      virtual-time clock was not also suspended, the missile would
	      suddenly jump forward as though much engine time had elapsed.
	    - Updated Apple/NeXT plug-in loading (NeXTLoadLibrary.cpp) to work
	      correctly with new plug-in search-path capabilites.  Also now
	      implements a meaningful csPrintLibraryError()
	    - Enhanced keyboard handling in the MacOS/X Server and OpenStep
	      ports to be compatible with Andrew's National Language Support
	      functionality.  (This feature is not yet fully implemented in the
	      NextStep port.  Doing so requires reverse engineering internal
	      NextStep data structures.)
	    - Implemented F1 - F12 function key translation in MacOS/X Server
	      and OpenStep ports.  (These keys are not yet implemented in the
	      NextStep port.)
	    - csEngineConfig is no longer an inner-class of csEngine.  This
	      change was made in order to work around a bug in the NextStep
	      compiler which was triggered after csObject (from which csEngine
	      inherits) was changed so that it inherits from iObject.  Somehow,
	      the compiler was getting confused by the QueryInterface(),
	      IncRef(), and DecRef() methods declared in csEngineConfig as well
	      as in iEngine and csObject (both of which csEngine inherits
	      from).  Making csEngineConfig stand-alone works around the
	      problem.
	    - In order to work around a multiple-inheritance bug in NextStep
	      compiler, changed the following classes so that they embed an SCF
	      interface rather than inherit from it:
		    iCameraPosition  -> csCameraPosition
		    iMaterialWrapper -> csMaterialWrapper
		    iRegion          -> csRegion
		    iSpriteTemplate  -> csSpriteTemplate
		    iTextureWrapper  -> csTextureWrapper
	      The compiler's symptom was that it did not think that IncRef(),
	      DecRef(), and QueryInterface() were implemented in classes which
	      inherited from iBase multiple times (through different paths).
	      *BEWARE* There were many places where the engine was dangerously
	      and blindly casting pointers between the interface and the
	      implementing class.  For instance, a pointer might be cast from a
	      csMaterialWrapper to an iMaterialWrapper or vice-versa.  Although
	      this worked when the implementing class inherited from the SCF
	      interface, it does _not_ work when the interface is embedded.
	      The danger here is that the compiler does not warn about this
	      problem since it assumes that the programmer knew what he or she
	      was doing when using the cast operation in the first place.  I
	      tried to repair all such broken and dangerous blind casts in
	      which the above classes were involved, but it is possible that I
	      missed one here or there.
	    - Added an assignment operator to ddgTriangle3 in order to appease
	      the NextStep compiler.
	    - Added a missing `inline' keyword to csCovMaskTriage::GetState().
	      The lack of this keyword resulted in this function being
	      implemented and exported from every single source file which
	      included the header.
	    - Unified the case of the `full-screen' extension as understood by
	      iGraphics2D::PerformExtension().  Some canvases expected
	      "fullscreen", whereas others expected "FullScreen".
	    - Added a preprocessor flag to Blocks which allows all of the
	      broken networking code to be disabled in one fell-swoop.
	    - Eliminated compilation warning in pttex.cpp.
	    - Minor modification to csphyzik/entity.h to appease broken
	      OpenStep compiler which wasn't instantiating template methods
	      early enough.  Worked around problem via simple textual
	      reordering of header so that templatized variables are declared
	      before they are actually referenced by inline methods.
	    - Augmented TrueType to CS font converter makfile (csfgen.mak) so
	      that its target only shows up on platforms which also build the
	      TrueType font server plug-in.
	    - Eliminated several compilation warnings in ddgchull.cpp regarding
	      use of enumeral and non-enumeral types in conditional expression.
	    - Added missing SYSDEF_ALLOC define to halogen2.cpp.
	    - Worked around minor compiler bug on NextStep which affected
	      csapp.cpp and txtmgr.cpp.
	    - Eliminated several compilation warnings about "unused computed
	      value" in CSWS and several applications which utilize CSWS, such
	      as cswstest and levtool.
	    - Worked around NextStep compiler limitation in null_pix.cpp and
	      drawpmap.cpp.
	    - 3dsout.cpp now includes cssysdefs.h in order to fake up a `bool'
	      type for compilers which do not support `bool' natively.
	    - Fixed error in me_app.cpp.  Was assinging an
	      mzModificationOriginDepth constant to a csVector3 instance.
	    - imotion.h no longer imports matrix3.h and quaterni.h.
	      iskeleton.h no longer imports transfrm.h.  Not only was this
	      unnecessary, but it also caused csSystemDriver to depend upon
	      these classes on NextStep, which was a less-than-desirable
	      consequence.  This resulted in linkage errors when linking the
	      csSystem library into applications which do not otherwise link
	      with the csGeometry library (such as scfreg).  (This problem is
	      specific to the NextStep compiler which generates references to
	      every mentioned class even if the class isn't actually used.)
	    - All source files in apps/t3d2cs and apps/t3d2cs/libt3d now import
	      cssysdef.h as the very first included file.  This ensures that
	      the `bool' type is faked up, if necessary, before it is used by
	      any other imported headers.
	    - Eliminated an "unused variable" warning in tBrush.cpp.
	    - Worked around a bizarre NextStep compiler bug which manifests as
	      an apparent corruption of the virtual table for csSprite2D.
	      Calls to QueryInterface() from a csSprite2D pointer would never
	      actually invoke the real, inherited csSprite::QueryInterface(),
	      and would instead always return NULL.  It is not even clear
	      which, if any, method was being called in lieu of the real
	      csSprite::QueryInterface().  Calls to QueryInterface() from a
	      local instance of csSprite2D would succeed as expected (since the
	      virtual table is not consulted in this case).  The work around
	      for this problem (for magical reasons) is to declare
	      QueryInterface() in csSprite2D which overrides the inherited
	      csSprite::QueryInterface().  It is sufficient for this method to
	      simply exist in csSprite2D.  Its actual implementation merely
	      invokes its superclass' QueryInterface().
17-Dec-2000
	- Brandon Ehle fixed a quaternion bug, with r initializer in the
	  wrong spot. The motion manager bug was fixed by this and
	  motions now look correct.
	- Started work on csfx library. Not finished yet. The csfx library
	  will contain stuff that is not general enough to be placed in the
	  engine but is general enough to be useful for several games. At
	  first I plan to add some procedural textures (i.e. like fire, water,
	  and plasma from the ptlab demo) and some of the particle systems
	  (like rain, fire, fountain, snow, ...).
	- Eric Sunshine temporarily disabled the sumlog.awk script which
	  performs CVS commit-time mailings.  This was necessary since gawk is
	  not present on the new CVS server which SourceForget installed, thus
	  all invocations of sumlog.awk were failing.
15-Dec-2000
	- Bugfix in csPolygon3D::ClipToPlane(). If the portal has a clipping
	  plane (can happen with floating portals) then it was possible that
	  this clipper would result in badly formed polygons generating
	  crashes or at least render errors in some cases. This problem
	  was visible with the new 'portal' console command. Note that
	  the problem is numerical. I'm not sure that my current fix will
	  eliminate the problem completely but at least I wasn't able to
	  reproduce it anymore.
	- Fixed the portal command so that the created portal always
	  faces the camera (at creation time only). The portal itself also
	  has the correct space warping transformation so that it appears
	  again at the starting point of the loaded world.
	- Changed csCameraPosition so that it inherits from csPObject
	  instead of csObject.
	- Added iCameraPosition and let csCameraPosition inherit from this.
	- Added iRegion/csRegion::FindCameraPosition().
	- Added iEngine/csEngine::FindCameraPosition().
	- csCameraPosition objects are now also supported by csRegion.
	- The portal command now correctly uses the real start position of
	  the loaded level (instead of just room,0,0,0) as given by the
	  'START' command.
	- The portal console command will now check if a region is already
	  loaded. If so then it will just open a new portal to the already
	  existing region.
	- The portal command will now also generate a portal back to the
	  world from which you created a portal. This only happens once though.
	  i.e. if you do 'portal maze' then you will get a portal from the
	  current position towards maze and a portal back from maze towards
	  the current position. If you then move to another position and
	  again do 'portal maze' you will only get a portal to maze and
	  not one back.
	- Renamed WalkTest::InitEngine() to InitCollDet() because that's
	  what it is doing.
	- If a new map file is loaded with the portal command the collision
	  detection stuff will be correctly initialized.
	- Moved the portal so that it is standing on the ground (relative
	  to the position of the player).
	- Known remaining issues with portal command:
	    - If you move through the portal your direction will not be
	      correct. This is caused by WalkTest having its own angle
	      vector which is not yet updated when passing a space
	      warping portal.
	    - If you started WalkTest from flarge (for example) then
	      typing 'portal flarge' will load a new instance. The reason
	      is that the default world is not placed in a region so the
	      portal command can't see that it is already loaded.
	    - Missiles can't penetrate the portal.
	    - Dynamic lights don't shine through the portal.
14-Dec-2000
	- Optimized csRegion::IsInRegion(). Replaced the loop over all
	  the objects in the region with a single test if the parent
	  of the given object is equal to the region.
	- Changed the behaviour of csEngine::FindSector, FindThing, FindSky,
	  FindThingTemplate, FindSprite, FindSpriteTemplate, FindTexture,
	  and FindMaterial. If onlyRegion is false then the behaviour is
	  as before but if onlyRegion is true then these functions will now
	  only return objects that are in the region AND also connected
	  to the engine. This contrasts with the old behaviour where these
	  functions could actually return objects that were not connected
	  to the world (example: do new csSector() and the created sector
	  will automatically be added to the current region, however it will
	  not be added automatically to the list of sectors in the engine).
	  The same functions in csRegion behave like they did before (i.e.
	  they can return objects that are not connected to the engine).
	- The previous change fixes the portal command so that it now
	  correctly loads another world and is able to create a portal to
	  that other world. Note that this doesn't complete the portal
	  command yet. A few extra things need to be done to make it
	  truely usable (initialize collision detection, engine mode
	  specific to sector instead of global to engine).
	- Added a warping transformation to the portal generated by the
	  'portal' command so that the portal destination matches the
	  starting point of the loaded level.
13-Dec-2000
	- Did a little further work on the engine SCF interfaces:
	    - Added iEngine/csEngine::FindTexture().
	    - Added iEngine/csEngine::CreateMaterial().
	    - Added iRegion/csRegion::FindTexture().
	    - Changed FindTexture/FindMaterial to return the pointer
	      to the texture/material on success instead of boolean.
	    - Added iView::Draw().
	    - Moved several defines for vectors in csCamera to iCamera.
	    - Added iEngine::GetBeginDrawFlags().
	    - Added iEngine::CreateLight.
	- The result of the SCF changes today and yesterday is that
	  simplep (the version of simple that uses the engine plugin) is
	  actually able to create geometry and show it.
	- Added iTextureWrapper SCF class and let csTextureWrapper implement
	  it.
	- Made some fixes to cs.i so that the Python plugin is now up-to-date
	  to the latest SCF changes.
12-Dec-2000
	- Thomas Hieber added two files to gamecore plugin which he
	  forgot to add in the past.
	- Michael Dale Long fixed the cctest console. Also did some
	  cosmetic code cleanup. Funky console is now enabled again.
	- Philip Wyett fixed a memory write error in the OpenGL texture
	  cache. This was causing an exit memory write error when exiting
	  'Blocks' in Windows.
	- Rene Dudfield made sprite lighting settings local to sprites so
	  that different sprites can use different settings.
	- Added ShineLights to iRegion/csRegion.
	- Added IsInRegion to iRegion/csRegion to check if some object
	  is in a region.
	- Extended csEngine::ShineLights with an optional csRegion
	  parameter to restrict recalculating lighting for some region.
	- Extended csPolyIt, csCurveIt, and csLightIt (iterators that
	  are defined in csEngine) with an optional csRegion parameter
	  to restrict iteration over the objects in that region.
	  Also extended csEngine::NewPolyIterator() and NewLightIterator()
	  functions.
	- Added GetLastSector() to csCurveIt and csLightIt (like csPolyIt).
	- The 'portal' console command works better now. In some cases
	  it 'almost' seems to be doing what it should. But it is still not
	  good enough. It crashes while trying to load some levels and
	  the portals in the other levels don't seem to be correct.
	  'portal sydney' is the only one which seems to work nicely
	  from flarge.
	- Did a little further work on the engine SCF interfaces:
	    - Added Prepare() to iEngine.
	    - csView now extends the already existing but empty iView.
	    - Added a few methods to iView.
	    - Added CreateView() to iEngine.
	    - Added lots of functions from csCamera to iCamera.
10-Dec-2000
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the project:
	    - Finally eliminated the evil monolithic apps/support/static.cpp
	      file which caused repeated maintenance headaches.  The problem
	      with this file was that every time a plug-in module was added or
	      removed from the project, a developer also had to remember to
	      edit static.cpp to reflect the change.  Thus, the perceived
	      modularity of plug-ins was offset by the very real monolithic
	      disposition of this file.
	    - As a replacement for static.cpp, the new makefile
	      CS/mk/static.mak automatically and dynamically synthesizes C++
	      code which forces hard symbolic references to each plug-in module
	      being linked into the application (assuming that the application
	      is being linked statically---that is, with USE_PLUGINS=no).
	    - Information used by the synthesis process is gleaned from the GNU
	      makefiles, project-wide.  The old CFLAGS.STATIC_SCF makefile
	      variable has been removed.  A new variable, SCF.STATIC, contains
	      a list of plug-in module basenames (such as `soft3d', `vfs',
	      etc.), and this information is used to synthesize the hard
	      references needed when linking applications statically.
	    - The static.mak makefile is smart enough to regenerate the
	      synthesized symbolic references when certain events occur; such
	      as when the user edits the list of plug-in modules in user.mak or
	      reconfigures the project's makefiles.
	    - Note that the new synthesis process is geared toward platforms
	      which utilize the GNU makefile system to build the project.  It
	      does not apply to ports which use `project files'.  However,
	      historically, none of the ports which rely on project files has
	      ever supported static linking, so this is no loss.  If, in the
	      future, a port does wish to support static linking via project
	      files, it would be a simple matter to set up an automated
	      synthesis task, and commit the result to the CVS repository on a
	      regular basis, much as is already done with MSVC project files.
	    - Added $(DEP.EXE) to the dependency lists of the following GUI
	      applications.  This should allow them to successfully link
	      statically (that is, when USE_PLUGINS is `no'):
		cctest
		g2dtest
	    - Removed $(DEP.EXE) from the dependency list of the following
	      console applications, since they need not link against the
	      various plug-in modules:
		csfgen
		makedep
		scfreg
		scftutor
		textconv
		uninst
9-Dec-2000
	- Added 'regionOnly' parameter to all 'FindXxx()' methods in
	  csEngine and iEngine. When this parameter is 'true' (default is
	  'false') only objects in the current region will be searched.
	- Added 'FindSky' to csEngine and iEngine.
	- Added all the 'FindXxx()' methods to csRegion and iRegion as well.
	- In addition added a general 'FindObject()' method to csRegion with
	  which you can find any object of a given name and type.
	- Added csThing::IsSky() which returns true if the thing is a sky
	  object.
	- Added optional is_template parameter to the constructor of csThing.
	  This is just to mark a thing as being a template. Usually this
	  should be set to true if the thing is pushed on the template list
	  in the engine. Also added IsTemplate() function to csThing to
	  query the status of this flag. Modified csLoader to correctly
	  set this flag in the constructor.
	- Added 'FindThingTemplate()' to csEngine, iEngine, csRegion, and
	  iRegion.
	- Added iSprite and iSpriteTemplate SCF classes and let csSprite
	  and csSpriteTemplate implement them. csSprite implements iSprite
	  through embedding (similar to how csThing implements iThing).
	  csSpriteTemplate implements iSpriteTemplate with (multiple)
	  inheritance.
	- Because iSprite is now implemented it is possible to actually
	  implement csRegion and csEngine::FindSprite. In addition because
	  iSpriteTemplate now exists I also added csRegion and csEngine::
	  FindSpriteTemplate. Also added to iRegion and iEngine.
	- Added iObject SCF interface. csObject now implements iObject.
	  iObject is currently almost empty (only contains GetName and
	  SetName). It's main purpose is to allow further definition of the
	  engine SCF interface for all methods that expect or return csObject
	  instances. This rather fundamental change triggered a number of
	  other changes in the engine classes with regards to where they
	  get the iBase implementation. Previously some of those classes
	  implemented iBase for sake of embedding or subclasses. Now, those
	  classes can use the iBase provided by csObject.
	- Fixed a bug in Blocks which caused crashes if no network driver
	  was present. Now it simply doesn't attempt to open a connection
	  if there is no network driver.
	- Implemented 'onlyRegion' support in csLoader by using the new
	  FindXxx() routines that were added to csEngine.
	- Extended csPObject thus that it correctly unlinks itself from its
	  parent at destruction time. Previously it didn't care which could
	  cause bad problems.
	- Also fixed csObject::ObjRelease() so that it actually resets the
	  parent to NULL at release time.
	- In addition fixed the csObject destructor so that the children
	  are destroyed the correct way now (given that destroying a child
	  will automatically remove it from the 'children' array).
	- The csObjectNoDel destructor has also been fixed so that it
	  sets the parent of all children to NULL (since they are now
	  unlinked).
	- All engine classes that can be added to a region now extend
	  csPObject instead of csObject. This is to make sure that they
	  actually maintain the parent (which is the region they are in).
	  When such an object is then deleted it will safely unlink itself
	  from the parent (region).
	- Added iRegion/csRegion::PrepareTextures() to prepare all textures
	  and materials that were loaded in the context of this region.
	- Renamed iRegion::Prepare() to PrepareSectors() and added a new
	  Prepare() which calls PrepareTextures() followed by PrepareSectors().
	  This way it works more like csEngine does.
	- All the above changes done today result in the 'portal' console
	  command not crashing anymore and loading the world given as a
	  parameter (probably) correctly in a new region. The 'portal' command
	  still doesn't work though because something is still wrong with
	  the portal.
8-Dec-2000
	- Samuel Humphreys did the following changes to phyztest:
	    - First stage of reformatting csphyziks to be more consistent
	      with itself and the Crystal Space style.
	    - Fixed the dissappearing block in phyztest..thx to Michaels
	      guidance.
	    - Added reportage of the main variables associated with the
	      block object.
	    - Changed the room to be a cube of 10 units each side centred
	      on the origin.
	- Samuel also fixed the bot cam so that it can traverse into the
	  new room of visual feasts (plasma, water, and fire).
	- Fixed a bug in cs.i for python. Eric Sunshine accidentally removed
	  the essential '3' after csVector3 :-)
	- Eric Sunshine moved command.cpp and command.h from apps/support to
	  apps/walktest since these files are only used by WalkTest. Updated
	  makefile and other source files to reflect this change.
	- Martin Geisse added a missing lib in the ds3d makefile.
	- Norman Kramer added missing include to a file in MazeD.
	- Wouter Wijngaards improved fire a bit. You can now show single
	  flames as well as a tiling wall of flame. Also added water and
	  plasma textures (all viewable in ptlab).
7-Dec-2000
	- Wouter Wijngaards made the fire polygon unlit in ptlab. This
	  looks better.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes:
	    - Renamed the following classes and SCF interfaces.  Fixed all
	      source files, header files, and documentation to reflect these
	      changes.
		    iWorld --> iEngine
		    csWorld --> csEngine
		    csWorldConfig --> csEngineConfig
		    csWorldState --> csEngineState
		    csWorldStateVector --> csEngineStateVector
	    - Renamed the following files.  Fixed all source files, header
	      files, and documentation to reflect these changes.
		    iworld.h --> iengine.h
		    world.h --> engine.h
		    world.cpp --> engine.cpp
		    worldfmt.txi --> mapfmt.txi
	    - Eliminated the old iEngine SCF interface and the iengine.h header
	      file.  This interface was just a very thin wrapper around the
	      existing iWorld (now iEngine) functionality.  However, since the
	      engine library already contains sufficient SCF goop to pass as a
	      plug-in module, the old thin iEngine wrapper was not actually
	      needed.  The new iEngine is now the one and only interface for
	      accessing the engine regardless of whether or not it is in a
	      plug-in module or statically linked.  There is no longer any
	      distinction.
	    - Renamed all `world' variables to 'engine' throughout the project
	      and documentation.  Renamed all variations of `world' (such as
	      `World', etc.), as well.  Also renamed `world file' references to
	      `map file' references.  Code and documentation which specifically
	      refers to `world space' or `world coordinates' has not changed.
	      In this case, the `world' terminology is appropriate and has been
	      retained.
	    - Added a bunch of missing `const' qualifiers to Dumper class.
	    - Renamed Dungeon plug-in's SCF name from
	      crystalspace.worldrnd.dungeon.std to crystalspace.dungeon.random.
	    - csProgressPulse now uses iSystem::Printf() rather than
	      CsPrintf(), thus it is no longer tied to the engine.  Also added
	      Doxygen comments.
	    - Enhanced the check for new C++ casting syntax in comptest.sh to
	      be more thorough.  It now checks for all casting variations.
	      This was necessary, since someone at NeXT botched the OpenStep
	      Objective-C++ compiler so that it fails to understand
	      reinterpret_cast even though it understands static_cast,
	      const_cast, and dynamic_cast.
	    - Eliminated compilation warning in csbaglay.cpp regarding one
	      variable shadowing another.
	    - NeXT csosdefs.h now defines __NEED_GENERIC_ISDIR for SYSDEF_DIR
	      so that the generic isdir() gets defined.  This is now required
	      by CSWS.
	    - Added missing `const' qualifier to SetName() and GetName()
	      methods of csFrame and csSpriteAction.
	    - Eliminated several compilation warnings from the sound loader
	      plug-in.
	    - Eliminated compilation warning about redefinition of RED_PREPROC
	      macro in haloscan.inc.  This warning only showed up on platforms
	      which have TOP8BITS_R8G8B8_USED defined.
	    - Eliminated several compilation warnings in g2dtest regarding
	      implicit conversion of float to int.
	    - Added missing `const' qualifiers to several methods in
	      mz3DSprite.
	    - Fixed quite a lot of multiple-include protection macros in
	      include/csengine so that they are now prefixed by `CS' (for
	      instance __CS_STATS_H__ rather than STATS_H).  This should help
	      to avoid naming collisions with non-CS packages.
	    - Eliminated compilation warning in ptlab.cpp.
	    - Eliminated compilation warning in dnfnodes.cpp.
6-Dec-2000
	- Fixed a comment in iGraphics2D.
	- Extend csObject::GetChild() with a new 'derived' parameter similar
	  to how GetIterator() works. With 'derived' set to true GetChild()
	  will return the first child that matches the type or is a type
	  derived from the given type. To get the first child you can now
	  use GetChild (csObject::Type, true);
	- Added iRegion SCF interface which csRegion extends.
	- Extended iWorld and csWorld with SelectRegion and GetCurrentRegion.
	- More work on csRegion class. DeleteAll(), Clear(), and Prepare()
	  should all work now. But untested at the moment.
	- All objects that should belong to a region will now add themselves
	  to the current region automatically.
	- Added new 'REGION' keyworld to WORLD in loader. This keyworld
	  will create/select a new region and all subsequent sectors,
	  collections, sprite templates or thing templates, will be added
	  to that region. If the name of the region is empty then the default
	  NULL region will be used. Note that it is possible to interleave
	  region selection. For example, you can first create a few sectors
	  in region 'east', followed by a few sectors in region 'west',
	  followed again by a few sectors in region 'east'.
	- Fixed a bug in csWorld::CreateThing(). This function accidently
	  added the thing twice to the list of things for every sector (once
	  by doing SetSector on the movable and once explicit). In addition
	  this routine forgot to add the thing to the list of things in the
	  world.
	- Added 'portal' console command to WalkTest. This will create a new
	  region with the given name and load the same named level into
	  that region. Then it will create a portal on the spot you are
	  standing to the start position of the new level. For example,
	  you can do 'portal maze' to load maze.zip into the 'maze' region.
	  Then you can enter 'maze.zip' through the new portal :-)
	  WARNING! This command does not work at the moment and the only
	  effect is crashing WalkTest! Work in Progress!
	- Added csLoader::AppendWorldFile() which will load a world
	  file without first clearing the original world.
	- Added a parameter 'onlyRegion' to AppendWorldFile(). If true then
	  then portals will only connect to the sectors in the current
	  region, things will only use thing templates defined in the
	  current region and sprites will only use sprite templates
	  defined in the current region.
	- Small fix in OpenGL which SHOULD support alpha for DrawPixmap
	  but for some reason doesn't.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed unixconf.sh so that it respects the CXX setting
	  from the environment if such a setting already exists, rather than
	  completely ignoring such a setting.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed some problems in cspython.mak and csjava.mak.
	- Eric Sunshine added automatic detection of SVGALIB to unixconf.sh.
	- Eric Sunshine removed the dead cygnus.mak makefile.
	- Eric Sunshine eliminated several compilation warnings from
	  crysball.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine added missing RequestPlugin(FontServer) to simplep.cpp.
	- Samuel Humphreys added a fire procedural texture to ptlab. The fire
	  algorithm was contributed by Wouter Wijngaards.
	- Martin Geisse fixed a bug which caused the sound modules to ignore
	  some config settings.
5-Dec-2000
	- Wouter Wijngaards created csBox3::SquaredOriginDist which returns
	  a float with the squared distance of the box to (0,0,0). It
	  is extremely fast (algo taken from sector.cpp).
	- Norman Kramer did the following changes:
	    - Catched a div by zero in LOD calc for sprites.
     	    - Sprites are now clipped if shortest distance is greater than
	      D() value of the farplane (squared version).
	- Started work on csRegion class. Not functional at the moment.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes:
	    - Removed all platform-specific specializations from of csdef.h.
	      These specializations have been moved to platform-specific
	      makefiles and include files, where appropriate.  The idea here is
	      to eliminate the mentality of monolithicism by moving as much
	      platform-specific goop into platform-specific configuration files
	      rather than polluting generalized project resources with
	      platform-specific crud.
	    - Moved all OS_NEXT-specific specializations out of csdef.h and
	      into next/csosdefs.h.
	    - csdef.h is no longer responsible for setting the OS_UNIX flag for
	      Solaris, Linux, Irix, BSD, BeOS, NeXT, and PS2.  It is now the
	      responsibility of each platform's makefile to set the OS_UNIX
	      flag, instead, if that designation is appropriate for the given
	      platform.
	    - Upgraded volatile.mak so that it has an understanding of
	      operating system `families', such as Unix, Win32, etc.  If it
	      sees that a platform-specific makefile has designated itself as
	      belonging to a particular family, then volatile.mak includes an
	      appropriate definition (such as OS_UNIX) in volatile.h.  All
	      platform-specific makefiles which require OS_UNIX now obtain it
	      via the new `family' mechanism.
	    - Added comptest.sh which tests for different compiler capabilities
	      at project configuration time.  Both unixconf.sh and next.mak now
	      invoke comptest.sh.
	    - Merged booltest.sh into comptest.sh.  Removed booltest.sh.
	    - Added a compiler capability test for new-style C++ casting syntax
	      to comptest.sh.  If the compiler does not understand this syntax,
	      then the makefile variable CS_USE_OLD_STYLE_CASTS is defined.
	      volatile.mak then defines the preprocessor variable
	      CS_USE_OLD_STYLE_CASTS which is recognized by csdef.h.
	    - Added a compiler capability test for the new C++ `explicit'
	      keyword.  If the compiler does not understand this keyword, then
	      the makefile variable CS_USE_FAKE_EXPLICIT_KEYWORD is defined.
	      volatile.mak then defines the preprocessor variable
	      CS_USE_FAKE_EXPLICIT_KEYWORD which is recognized by csdef.h.
	    - Renamed makefile and preprocessor variables DO_FAKE_BOOL to
	      CS_USE_FAKE_BOOL_TYPE.
	    - Renamed makefile and preprocessor variables DO_FAKE_SOCKLEN_T to
	      CS_USE_FAKE_SOCKLEN_TYPE.
	    - Moved initial definition of MAKE_VOLATILE_H out of Makefile and
	      into volatile.mak.
	    - Reworked the STATIC_CAST, DYNAMIC_CAST, REINTERPRET_CAST, and
	      CONST_CAST macros so that the user is no longer responsible for
	      remembering to add extra parentheses around the expression which
	      is being casted.
	    - Eliminated Linux-specific specializations from makedep/parse.cpp.
	    - Eliminated NextStep-specific specializations from bspbox.cpp.
	    - Eliminated platform-specific specializations from scf.h and moved
	      them into the appropriate platform-specific csosdefs.h files.  In
	      particular, the Windows, BeOS, and OS/2 configuration files now
	      override the default function export mechanism rather than
	      hard-coding such platform-specific knowledge into SCF.
	    - Created include/cssys/csosdefs.h which takes over the
	      responsibility of including the platform-specific csosdefs.h from
	      cssysdef.h.  This helps to remove some platform-specific
	      specialization from cssysdef.h.
	    - Eliminated all platform-specific specializations from version.h.
	      It is now the responsibility of the platform-specific makefile
	      and project files to provide this information on behalf of
	      version.h.  The idea here is to eliminate the mentality of
	      monolithicism and promote the concept of modularity, rather than
	      polluting generalized project resources, such as version.h, with
	      platform-, processor-, and compiler-specific crud.  For all
	      platforms which use the GNU makefile system, this information is
	      now provided automatically by volatile.mak by gleaning the
	      necessary information from the existing GNU makefiles.  In
	      particular, volatile.mak examines the makefile variables
	      $(DESCRIPTION.$(TARGET)), $(PROC), and $(COMP) in order to
	      provide useful human-readable information to version.h.
	    - Renamed the following preprocessor identifiers from version.h
	      (some of which are now defined by platform-specific project files
	      rather than being defined directly in version.h):
		CS_VERSION    --> CS_VERSION_MAJOR
		CS_SUBVERSION --> CS_VERSION_MINOR
		VERSION       --> CS_VERSION
		RELEASE_DATE  --> CS_RELEASE_DATE
		OS_VERSION    --> CS_PLATFORM_NAME
		PR_VERSION    --> CS_PROCESSOR_NAME
		CC_VERSION    --> CS_COMPILER_NAME
	    - Renamed the plug-in file extension for MacOS/X Server, OpenStep,
	      and NextStep from .dylib to .csplugin.
	    - Added general/findlib.cpp to SRC.SYS_CSSYS in next.mak.
4-Dec-2000
	- Norman Kramer implemented farplane culling for sprites.
	- Added 'sndload' to the 'walkall' target because without the
	  sound loader WalkTest will not run.
	- Fixed a number of compile errors that trigger with VC5.
3-Dec-2000
	- Norman Kramer did some work on CrystalBall (his polygon culler).
	- Norman also did the following with relation to the c-buffer
	  culler:
	    - GetConvexOutline (in csBox) has a new parameter: bVisisble.
              If true it returns all visible corners, if not then just
	      the outline.
	    - The farplane is now recognized in the octree culling and
	      polygon culling process.
	- Noah L. Gibbs added support for change to libs/csphyzik/qtrbconn.cpp.
	  Also some prototypes for new functions. Here is the comment:
	      Checking in code that's almost enough to make the rigid-body
	      connectors useful. They now successfully take derivatives of
	      an arbitrary point and its velocity on the rigid body with
	      respect to all state variables of that body -- except for the
	      derivative of the velocity with respect to the rigid body's
	      angular momentum.  Ouch.  Working on it.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to the documentation:
	    - Fixed several Texinfo mark-up problems in msdos.txi, win32.txi,
	      win32gcc.txi, 
	    - Performed some re-writing and clean-up of features.txi.
	    - Performed some minor reformatting of csgeom.txi, graphics.txi,
	      and plugins/overview.txi.
	    - Performed some minor re-writing of cssys.txi.
	    - Replaced Doc++ references with Doxygen references in coding.txi.
	- Eric Sunshine made the following changes to CVSROOT/sumlog.awk (and
	    cousins):
	    - Minor beautification of generated output in order to facilitate
	      ease of reading.
	    - Now ensures that all developers have write access to temporary
	      working directory.  This should prevent the problem of
	      "permission denied" errors which occurred for some users when
	      committing files.
	- Eric Sunshine added missing FontPlex registration to static.cpp.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed copy/paste error in fontplex.mak.
	- Eric Sunshine removed references to the obsolete and long dead
	  Amiga and Watcom ports.
	- Eric Sunshine removed the following modules and resources from the
	  project.  Also removed all references to these modules from
	  documentation, source and header files, configuration files, etc.
	  All removed resources were tagged with the name "PURGE_1" just before
	  being purged to CVS's "Attic".  This tag may be used to easily
	  recover any module or resource back to the state it was in just prior
	  to removal.

2-Dec-2000
	- Seth Galbraith did the following changes to sprites:
	    - Automatic level-of-detail adjustment based on distance and
	      field-of-view.
	    - cfg_lod_detail (the "lod" setting in Walktest) is now
	      basically the distance at which full detail is visible
	      instead of a fractional value.
	- Seth also added -mconsole to the linking flags for win32gcc.mak.
          He also added comments explaining what to expect if you
	  comment-out the -mconsole option.
	- Wouter Wijngaards improved WalkTest as follows:
	    - Finetuned the parameters for the 'flame' demo particle system.
	      It looks better now, less blocky.
	    - Removed those irritating 1 pixel wide margins where pixels
	      from the console text could still be seen. At the end of
	      initialize, ClearAll() is called.
1-Dec-2000
	- Andrew Zabolotny tried to fix OpenGL library problems.
	  LIBS.OPENGL.SYSTEM is now the correct variable to define the
	  system libraries for OpenGL support. For example (in system
	  makefile or in config.mak):
	    LIBS.OPENGL.SYSTEM=-L/usr/local/include/MesaGL -lMesaGL
