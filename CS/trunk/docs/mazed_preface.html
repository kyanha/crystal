<H1>Preface</H1>
<P>
This section contains some auxiliary info that most of you won't want to spend
the time to read it. However, I feel obliged to include it, at least to
anticipate a number of letters with questions like
"why you made it? there are a lot around already" and so on.

<H2>A bit of history</H2>

The prototype for MazeD was ObjMaker, a 3D editor I wrote about 1993 in Pascal
for DOS :-) Since nobody has seen it, I think you don't care about it, but I'm
feeling oblige to mention it. It ran in 360x240 and allowed building simple
objects (vertices & faces < 2048) with flat, gouraud, phong, texture-mapped,
steel (guess what's it? :-) and color-mix shaded faces. It ran very fast even
on 386DX/40, not speaking of current Pentiums :-) Here is how it looks like:

There are a lot of 3D editors floating around, so why bothering and creating
just another one? - you'll ask. The reasons for creating Maze Editor were:
<OL>
  <LI>Most <B>good</B> 3D editors are not free. I won't say it's a big bargain
      paying 20 bucks for a good editor, but non-free software always comes
      without source code, and I hate software without source code. I never
      seen a program which completely fits my needs, so having the possibility
      to add a couple of features which makes me feel comfortable is a big win.
  <LI>Most 3D editors are designed for Quake. Since CrystalSpace has its own
      features (like, for example, mirrors) those editors cannot use all
      features of CrystalSpace. Besides, you will need some kind of convertor
      to convert Quake maps which uses BSP into CrystalSpace worlds which uses
      portals. Any convertor always has its limitations and glitches. So, with
      a BSP editor you will always get second-hand worlds.
  <LI>All 3D editors I know about are platform-specific. You cannot choose the
      OS you will run when you know software you need is designed for another
      OS. MazeD will run (more or less well) on any platform supported by
      CrystalSpace itself, since it is based on same low-level support as
      CrystalSpace itself.
  <LI>Like most free and source-code-available software, MazeD have all chances
      to become the most (I hope) feature-rich editor around. The power of any
      group of developers simply cannot compare with lots'of'people lurking
      on the Net :-)
</OL>
There were as well other reasons, but these are the most important.
