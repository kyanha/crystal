was released. This file may help you convert your application
to 0.16 when that will be released. It can also help you convert
to 0.15 if you want to do that.

csSector::UseStaticBSP(int mode = BSP_MINIMIZE_SPLITS) has changed to
csSector::UseStaticTree(int mode = BSP_MINIMIZE_SPLITS, bool octree = false).

Added void csPolygonSet::GetBoundingBox(csVector3& min_bbox, csVector3& max_bbox).

Added const csReversibleTransform& csPortal::GetWarp ().

csBspTree inherits from new class csPolygonTree.
Added csOctree which also inherits from csPolygonTree.

csPolygonSet::AddVertexSmart() is no longer recommended (too slow). Instead
use plain AddVertex() and call CompressVertices() afterwards.

New csSector::RemoveThing().
