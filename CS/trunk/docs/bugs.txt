PROBLEM: AMD and K6 processors seem to have problems with CS?
SOLUTION: No idea yet. This needs to be investigated. Does every AMD
and K6 owner have problems?
DIFFICULTY: moderate to hard?

PROBLEM: Halos are missing in some 3D hardware accelerated drivers
(OpenGL and Glide).
SOLUTION: A more general solution (alpha mapped texture?) may solve all
problems at once. Or else implement it ad hoc again.
DIFFICULTY: moderate to hard

PROBLEM: No fog in hardware accelerated renderers.
SOLUTION: Currently Jorrit is working on vertex based fog. It is not
ready yet but it is probably the best way.
DIFFICULTY: moderate to hard

PROBLEM: When standing VERY close to the portal engine sometimes draw it
(shouldn't -- for example I found one position near the exit from the
startup room in large.zip. But it's pretty hard to find)
SOLUTION: I think projecting code should be revisited to change it's
operation when Z-value of polygon vertices is very little. Maybe bug in
the clipper. (mrsigma@surrey.quik.com)
DIFFICULTY: Jorrit: solved more or less by reducing SMALL_Z from 0.1 to 0.01.
This will not avoid the problem completely but the chance of it occuring
will be very small now.

PROBLEM: Turn on 'freelook' and look around in mirror.zip. After some time
CS will crash while trying to draw a polygon.
SOLUTION: No idea?
DIFFICULTY: moderate?

PROBLEM: Bots are unstable. Cause crashes often because of faulty collision detection.
SOLUTION: probably rewrite them using CD system. However bug may be indicative
of something internal which is wrong in CS since in principle the ad hoc
CD method should work.
DIFFICULTY: moderate

PROBLEM: The missile sometimes gets stuck in the wall.
SOLUTION: This is also due to broken collision detection which should
be rewritten using the real CD system.
DIFFICULTY: moderate

PROBLEM: Lightmapping of curves is still a bit wrong.
SOLUTION: further investigation is needed.
DIFFICULTY: moderate

PROBLEM: As far as I know the previously mentioned semi-transparent texture
feature is also not supported by the 3D hardware accelerated drivers.
SOLUTION: Look for a suitable solution.
DIFFICULTY: moderate

PROBLEM: Glide doesn't support 2D text yet.
SOLUTION: It is coming.
DIFFICULTY: moderate

PROBLEM: Unlighted texture mapper distorts textures when looking
in a strange direction to them.
SOLUTION: Further investigation is needed.
DIFFICULTY: moderate

PROBLEM: Lightmaps on OpenGL in Win32 look very rough. There are no
smooth transitions from level to level. - RivaTNT, Detonator drivers.
(thieber@gmx.net)
SOLUTION: Investigation?
DIFFICULTY: moderate?

PROBLEM: Lightmapping in Glide is still broken.
SOLUTION: Don't know (someone who manages Glide port just have to look,
since OpenGL and DirectX have correct mapping)
DIFFICULTY: Moderate?

PROBLEM: No halos in 8-bit and 32-bit display mode.
SOLUTION: 32-bit display mode is easy. It just
needs to be done. 8-bit is another matter.
DIFFICULTY: easy to moderate

PROBLEM: Semi-transparent textures (textures in which one color is completely
transparent and the rest is opaque) only work correctly in 16-bit color. In
32-bit color there is no transparancy and in 8-bit color there is only
transparency in some cases.
SOLUTION: For the 8-bit problem I suspect there is a problem in the texture
cache here (maybe the difference between 'white light only' and 'general color').
32-bit transparancy needs to be investigated.
DIFFICULTY: easy

PROBLEM: MazeD only works in windowed mode (on Windows).
SOLUTION: Rewrite buggy getpage() method in Windows renderer.
DIFFICULTY: easy

PROBLEM: Lighting still has a bug that it sometimes rejects polygons
which are affected by the light but it thinks they are not.
SOLUTION: just need a better test.
DIFFICULTY: easy

PROBLEM: Enabling texel filtering causes incorrect selection of scanline
drawers depending on mipmap level. This causes things to disappear
when they are close.
SOLUTION: just have a look.
DIFFICULTY: probably easy
