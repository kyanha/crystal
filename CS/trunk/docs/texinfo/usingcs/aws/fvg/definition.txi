@subsection Flexible Vector Graphics Definition

Flexible Vector Graphics is a subset of Scalable Vector Graphics.  It stays as close
as possible to the SVG 1.1 specification, while omitting some of the more complex
operations.

Here we will define the functionality of @sc{fvg} and make some notes about particular 
differences between SVG and @sc{fvg}.  

@subsubheading Defining a Shape

@sc{fvg} should be included directly in AWS's XML definition files.  Just as the normal
definition files can use automation constructs, fvg can too.

@subsubheading Basic Shapes

FVG includes all the same basic shapes as SVG 1.1.
