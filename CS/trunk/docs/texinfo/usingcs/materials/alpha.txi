Crystal Space supports the alpha channel that can be present in some image
files (like @sc{png} and @sc{tga}).

It is important to realize that when you use alpha on an object you must
sort the object back to front. That basically means you'll most likely have
to use the @samp{alpha} render priority (@pxref{HOWTO Render Priorities}) and
also @samp{ztest} for the Z-buffer usage. Also in some cases you may need
to set the @samp{back2front} flag if the object is a genmesh
(@pxref{MeshObject Genmesh}).

It is often hard to get things correct with such a setup so in many cases
it is preferable to use @dfn{keycolor} instead of alpha. This is only possible
if the alpha channel only contains 0% and 100% transparency values. The
easiest way to do that is to mark the texture as follows in your world file:

@example
<texture name="transparent">
    <file>mytexture.png</file>
    <alpha><binary/></alpha>
</texture>
@end example

If you do this then this texture can be used on objects as any other texture.
So the object can simply use @samp{object} render priority and @samp{zuse}
Z-buffer mode.
