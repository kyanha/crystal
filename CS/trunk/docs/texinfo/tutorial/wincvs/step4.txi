@subsection Step 4: Setting WinCVS Preferences

First, start the WinCVS client software.  If it is the first time after
installation of the client you will be presented with the @emph{Tip of the Day}
dialog box.  Just click on @emph{Close} for the time being.

@ifnotinfo
@picturess{tutorial,wincvs,wincvs01}

@end ifnotinfo
You will now be presented with the WinCVS Preferences dialog box.  If it is not
the first time running the WinCVS client, then from the file menu click on
@emph{Admin} then @emph{Preferences}
@ifnotinfo
The following dialog box will appear.

@picturess{tutorial,wincvs,wincvs02}
@end ifnotinfo

@ifinfo
Now fill in this dialog box by setting the @emph{Authentication} field
to @emph{"passwd" file on the cvs server"} and the @sc{cvsroot} setting to
the following value:

@example
:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/crystal
@end example

@end ifinfo
@ifnotinfo
Now fill in this dialog box to match the screenshot below.

@picturess{tutorial,wincvs,wincvs03}

@end ifnotinfo
@emph{Note}: Developers with @sc{cvs} write-access should replace
@samp{:pserver:} with @samp{:ext:} and @samp{anonymous} with their SourceForge
username.  Developers also need to change the @emph{Authentication} field to
@emph{@sc{ssh} Server}.

@emph{Note}: Replace @samp{cvs.crystal.sourceforge.net} with @samp{cvs.sourceforge.net}!

Next, click on the property sheet tab @emph{Globals} and edit to match the
screenshot below.

@ifnotinfo
@picturess{tutorial,wincvs,wincvs04}

@end ifnotinfo
Next click on the WinCVS property sheet tab and you'll realize why earlier you
created a home directory.  With the browse button to the right of the @sc{home}
edit box, browse and point it to your home directory.  If you created your home
directory on your @file{c:\} drive, it should look as the screenshot below.

@ifnotinfo
@picturess{tutorial,wincvs,wincvs05}

@end ifnotinfo
Now click on the @sc{ok} button to apply the changes made.

In the bottom @emph{Output} window of the client you should see the following
appear.

@example
NEW CVSROOT:
:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/crystal
(password authentication)
@end example

Developers with write access to the server, will see something similar:

@example
NEW CVSROOT:
:ext:myusername@@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/crystal
(ssh authentication)
@end example
