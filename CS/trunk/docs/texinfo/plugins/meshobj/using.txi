This section explains how to use Mesh Objects in general.  It doesn't go into
detail about the specific Mesh Object Types that Crystal Space supports.

@subsubheading General

When the engine works with instances of Mesh Objects it does so through the
@samp{iMeshWrapper} interface.  @samp{iMeshWrapper} holds the reference to the
@samp{iMeshObject} instances implementing the particular type of Mesh Object.
@samp{iMeshWrapper} is responsible for deciding when to draw a Mesh Object and
when to light it.  @samp{iMeshWrapper} also manages the position of the object
in the world and manages possible hierarchical transformations (i.e.
@samp{iMeshWrapper} has an array of @samp{iMeshWrapper} children).

@subsubheading Loading From Map File

The easiest way to use Mesh Objects is to simply specify them in the map file
for your level.  There are two things that you need to do for that.  First you
have to specify an entry at top-level (directly inside the @samp{world}
statement) like this (this example uses the @dfn{fountain} plug-in to make a
fountain):

@example
<meshfact name="fountainFactory">
  <plugin>crystalspace.mesh.loader.factory.fountain</plugin>
  <params />
</meshfact>
@end example

This will use the @dfn{mesh object loader} plug-in which is identified by the
@sc{scf} name mentioned by the @code{plugin} statement to load a factory
(type @samp{iMeshObjectFactory}) and register it with the engine.  There are no
parameters for the fountain's Mesh Object Factory so that's why the
@samp{params} block is empty.  But you still have to specify it.  Other mesh
object factories may accept parameters.

Because the fountain defines no parameters for the Mesh Object Factory
you only have to create one factory in order to make all fountains you need.
But in some cases you may have to create multiple factories depending
on the object characteristics you want.

To place a fountain in some room (sector) you use a @samp{meshobj}
statement, within the definition of a room or sector, like this:

@example
<meshobj name="fountain">
  <plugin>crystalspace.mesh.loader.fountain</plugin>
  <params>
    <factory>fountainFactory</factory>
    <number>300</number>
    <material>spark</material>
    <origin x="0" y="0" z="0"/>
    <dropsize w=".05" h=".05"/>
    <color red="0.7" green="0.9" blue="1.0"/>
    <accel x="0" y="-.1" z="0"/>
    <falltime>3</falltime>
    <speed>1</speed>
    <elevation>1.5</elevation>
    <azimuth>0</azimuth>
    <opening>.2</opening>
    <mixmode>
      <add />
    </mixmode>
  </params>
  <move>
    <v x="-10" y="-1" z="14"/>
    <matrix>
      <rot x="1.5"/>
    </matrix>
  </move>
</meshobj>
@end example

This code fragment uses the @samp{crystalspace.mesh.loader.fountain} loader
plug-in named
to load a Mesh Object (type
@samp{iMeshObject}) and register it with the engine (while placing it in the
current sector).  In this case there are many parameters.  The first parameter
should always be the name of the factory.  This is true for all Mesh Objects
regardless of their type.  For a complete list of parameters available, you
should refer to the fountain documentation.

The @samp{move} statement is outside of the @samp{params} block.  The reason
for this is that the position of Mesh Objects is controlled by the engine and
not by the Mesh Object itself.

In addition to the above statements you can also nest other @samp{meshobj}
statements to create a hierarchy of Mesh Objects (not shown in the example
above).  If you do that, then the @samp{move} statement must be interpreted
relative to the parent.

When you have Mesh Objects loaded into Crystal Space using the map file syntax
illustrated above, then you can query the parameters from your application by
using the standard @sc{api} in the @samp{iEngine} interface.

@subsubheading Using Directly From Code

You can also create Mesh Objects directly from your application.  To do this,
roughly, you have to perform the following steps:

@itemize
@item
Load the Mesh Object Type with @code{CS_LOAD_PLUGIN()} (preferably after checking
if it is already loaded, by calling @code{CS_QUERY_PLUGIN_CLASS()}).

@item
Create at least one Mesh Object Factory by calling @code{NewFactory()} on the
Mesh Object Type instance.

@item
If the factory has parameters you can call @code{SCF_QUERY_INTERFACE()} to get a
handle to the @samp{iSomethingFactoryState} interface (replace @emph{Something}
with whatever the type name of the Mesh Object is).  Then you set the
parameters you want on that factory.

@item
Create one or more Mesh Object instances by using one of your factories and
calling @code{NewInstance()} on them.

@item
If the object has parameters you use @code{SCF_QUERY_INTERFACE()} to get a handle
to the @samp{iSomethingState} interface (replace @emph{Something} with whatever
the type name of the Mesh Object is).  Then set the parameters you want on the
Mesh Object.  Note that there are Mesh Object implementations which have
multiple interfaces like this (for example, the particle systems implement both
@samp{iParticleState} plus another particle system-dependent interface).

@item
For every instance of @samp{iMeshObject} you need to create a
@samp{iMeshWrapper} instance for the engine.  Then you set up the
@samp{iMeshWrapper} by placing it in the sector that you want it and setup its
position and rotation (transformation).
@end itemize

Here is a code example for creating an instance of the ball plug-in.

@example
void Initialize ()
@{
  @dots{}
  // Get the ball mesh object plug-in.
  ball_type = CS_QUERY_PLUGIN_CLASS (this,
    "crystalspace.mesh.object.ball", iMeshObjectType);
  if (!ball_type)
    ball_type = CS_LOAD_PLUGIN (this,
      "crystalspace.mesh.object.ball", iMeshObjectType);
  if (!ball_type)
    Printf (CS_MSG_WARNING, "No ball type plug-in found!\n");
  ball_factory = ball_type->NewFactory ();
  @dots{}
@}
@dots{}
void SetupWorld ()
@{
  @dots{}
  // Make a ball using the ball plug-in.
  csRef<iMeshObject> ballMesh = ball_factory->NewInstance ();
  csRef<iBallState> ballState =
    SCF_QUERY_INTERFACE (ballMesh, iBallState);
  ballState->SetRadius (.5, .5, .5);
  ballState->SetMaterialWrapper (material);
  ballState->SetRimVertices (12);

  csRef<iMeshWrapper> ball =
    engine->CreateMeshWrapper (ballMesh, "MyBall", room);
  m.Identity ();
  ball->GetMovable ().SetTransform (m);
  ball->GetMovable ().SetPosition (csVector3 (-3, 5, -3));
  ball->GetMovable ().UpdateMove ();
  ball->DeferUpdateLighting (
    CS_NLIGHT_STATIC | CS_NLIGHT_DYNAMIC, 10);
  @dots{}
@}
@end example

This example will load a ball using the plug-in and place it at (-3,5,-3) in
@samp{room}.  It will also make sure that it will be lit by the 10 closest
lights.

@samp{iBallState} is the state interface for setting the characteristics of
ball Mesh Objects.
