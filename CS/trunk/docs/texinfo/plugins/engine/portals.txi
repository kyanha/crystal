The world in Crystal Space is defined with @dfn{Sectors}. A sector is
an area of space that itself does not represent geometry but can
contain objects that represent geometry. In this discussion we will limit
ourselves to mesh objects of the @dfn{Thing} type since things implement
@dfn{portals}.

A sector is in principle an infinite area of space. But usually the
sector has logical bounds which are made from some mesh object. In this
discussion we will use the thing mesh object to make sector boundaries.

You can define multiple sectors and connect them together by using
portals in one or more of the things.

Assume that you want to define a large room with a pillar in the middle of the
room.  You can do this two ways; either with four sectors, or with one sector.
First let us define it with four sectors.

@noindent
As seen from above, the sectors would look something like this:

@picturess{plugins,engine,portal1}

@noindent
Sector S1 is composed of eight polygons (including the top and bottom polygon
for its roof and floor, as well as the three polygons at the east side).  The
two polygons adjacent to sectors S2 and S4 are portals to the respective
sectors.  All the other polygons are texture mapped as normal.

@noindent
Sectors S2 and S4 have six polygons each.  Their west polygons are again
portals to sector S1.  Their east polygons are portals to sector S3.

@noindent
Sector S3 is defined as is sector S1.

Another way to define this room using just the same four sectors could be done
as follows:

@picturess{plugins,engine,portal2}

@noindent
To the person standing in this room this makes no difference at all.

There are many other ways to define this room using the four sectors.  One
important thing to note is that four is the minimum number of Sectors that you
need to define this room if you want to render the polygons using Z-fill
mode (this means that the Z-buffer is updated but not tested). If you want
to be able to render using Z-fill mode a sector has to be @dfn{convex}.

An easier way to define this room is by using only one Sector and one Thing
to define the pillar, as shown below.

@picturess{plugins,engine,thing}

Again this makes no difference for the person standing in this room.  There
is, however, a difference in performance.  If the pillar is very large and
wide the first approach will probably be faster.  If the pillar is very thin
it is more efficient to use only one sector with one thing.  The reason (as
will be made clear later) is that the pillar Thing has to be rendered
using Z-use mode (i.e. full use of the Z-buffer). In this scenario there
is a lot more overdraw compared to the four sector approach (sidenote:
on fast 3D cards this overdraw actually does not matter so this approach
is now considered to be better in all cases).

Using Things like this make it easier to define worlds. If they are small
enough they will also enhance performance.

With Sectors, Portals, and Things you can describe virtually any world that
you want.  Note that all polygons of a Thing can be portals, even the floor
and ceiling polygons.  In fact there is no special attribute for a floor or
ceiling polygon.  All polygons are equivalent.

@subsubheading Sectors
@cindex Sectors
@cindex visibility culler

In this section I will describe Sectors a bit more thoroughly.  As stated
before sectors represent infinite space. You can fill a sector with geometry
by using mesh objects (@pxref{MeshObject}).

With a sector there is always an associated visibility culler. Currently
Crystal Space supports two cullers:
@itemize
@item
@samp{frustvis}: This is the default visibility culler that is used if no
other is specified. It only does frustum culling. It is the best culler to
use for simple sectors that don't have a lot of objects or else for sectors
that are big but where all objects are small. For such sectors it doesn't
make much sense to try to do more complicated visibility culling so
frustum cullling (testing if an object is visible in the current view)
is more than enough.
@item
@samp{dynavis}: This is a more advanced visibility culler that does
frustum culling in addition to trying to avoid rendering objects that
are obscured by other objects (@pxref{Visibility Culling}). This culler
is mainly useful when you have big complex sectors with lots of objects
and when objects have a good chance of occluding (hiding) other objects.

@subsubheading Things
@cindex Things

A Thing is one of the basic building blocks to create geometry in
Crystal Space. A Thing is made from convex polygons.

Things (and other mesh objects for that matter) can be rendered using
Z-fill or Z-use mode. With Z-fill the previous contents of the Z-buffer
(where that Thing is rendered) is just overwritten. With Z-use the
previous contents is checked in order to see if the Thing is in front
or behind the polygons that are already on screen. If you have a convex
object (like the outer polygons of a room) then you can use Z-fill because
the polygons will not overlap. Things which are then inside those walls
will need to use Z-use in order not to overwrite each other.

Note that polygons have a visible side and an invisible side (backface
culling).

All polygons can be portals. Portals can point to another sector
or to the same sector (in case of a mirror).

@subsubheading Polygons
@cindex Polygons

Things are made of 3D polygons.  As mentioned before polygons must
be convex.  The vertices of polygons are oriented clockwise.  This fact is
used for backface culling; a polygon has only one visible side.

Polygons are drawn with a texture.  How the texture is mapped on the polygon
depends on a transformation matrix.  This is general enough so that you can
translate, rotate, scale, and mirror the texture in every possible direction.
The texture is tiled across the polygon surface.

In a pre-computing stage three light-maps are created for every polygon (this
is explained in more detail later).  Lighting is sampled in a grid which is 16
by 16 texture pixels (or @dfn{texels}) in size, by default.  Bilinear
interpolation is used by the texture caching machinery to make this lighting
appear smooth.  The end result of this is a non-tiled lighted texture that is
mapped across the polygon surface.

A polygon can also be a Portal (see below).  Normally a portal polygon is not
texture mapped unless the texture is semi-transparent.

@subsubheading Portals
@cindex Portals

A Portal is a special kind of polygon.

Instead of texture mapping a portal polygon, the renderer will recursively
draw the sector that this portal points to.  After this, if the texture is
semi-transparent, the texture will be mapped over the already rendered
sector.

Portals can also transform space.  This feature can be used to implement
mirrors or reflecting surfaces.

Note that when there is a portal from sector A to sector B you should probably
also define a portal from sector B to sector A.  Adjacent polygons of
different sectors are not shared so you need to set a portal on each of them.
Otherwise you will have the effect that you can see from sector A to sector B
but not the other way around.

A special feature of portals is that you could (in theory) have a portal from
sector A to sector B, but instead of going back to sector A from sector B you
could set the portal to point at sector C which (in this example) would be a
sector which has the same world space coordinates as sector A.  This is
perfectly possible (although maybe not desirable) with Crystal Space.  An
important result of this is that a given world space coordinate can belong to
more than one sector!  A corollary of this is that you always need a current
sector reference together with a world space coordinate to really know where
you are.

Portals in Crystal Space solve the problem of polygon sorting.  All polygons
in the current sector are certainly visible (unless they are behind the view
plane) and do not overlap, so they can just be drawn in any order without
overdraw and without conflicts.  If a portal polygon is reached, all polygons
in that other sector are behind all the polygons in the current sector.  In
fact portals are an explicit form of @sc{bsp} tree.  The advantages of this
approach are summarized below.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Overdraw elimination comes for free with portals.

@item
Space warping can be used as described above.

@item
In theory it would be rather easy to make dynamic worlds.  Because the portals
are explicit it is easy to define them so that certain sectors can move and
transform in certain ways.
Note that static lighting makes this a bit difficult in some cases.
@end itemize

One disadvantage a portal engine is that it can be more difficult to define
worlds. If you want to be able to use @sc{zfill} mode you must make all
sectors convex. If you don't care about that then you can use @sc{zuse} too.

@subsubheading Rendering The World
@cindex Rendering The World

This section describes the various steps taken by the engine to actually
render the world.  The camera and a view 2D polygon are given as parameters
(the view polygon defines what is visible on the screen).

Note that this discussion explains how thing polygons are rendered using
the current implementation. As this implementation is not hardware friendly
(i.e. it doesn't allow for hardware accelerated transforms) we will change
this in the future. Note that some of the other objects (like genmesh,
spr3d, @dots{}) correctly support hardware accelerated transforms already.

Also note that most things now also render using a faster technique (fastmesh).

@enumerate
@item
First the mesh objects of the current sector are transformed from world to
camera space using the given camera (this means that all of the vertices are
transformed).

@item
Then, for every polygon of the current mesh object do the following:

@enumerate a
@item
Perform perspective correction (division by @samp{Z}) on all the vertices of
the polygon.

@item
If all of the vertices are behind the viewplane (@samp{Z=EPSILON}) then the
polygon is not visible and need not be drawn.

@item
Perform backface culling to see if the polygon can be visible.  Note that for
the current sector all polygons are always visible but this step is important
if drawing the sector behind a portal.

@item
If all of the vertices are in front of the viewplane then the polygon is
completely visible.  Skip the following step.

@item
Otherwise clip the polygon against the viewplane.

@item
If the polygon is still visible after all these steps transform the texture
mapping matrix from world@result{}texture to camera@result{}texture.  Also
transform the plane normal of the polygon to camera space.

@item
Now clip the polygon against the view polygon.  The view polygon is a general
2D polygon, not just a rectangle.

@item
If the resulting 2D polygon is not a portal it is just drawn on the screen.

@item
Otherwise this routine is recursively called again with the sector that the
portal points to as the current sector and the resulting clipped 2D polygon as
a new view polygon.  If the texture of the portal polygon is semi-transparent
it is drawn over the resulting image.
@end enumerate

@end enumerate

@noindent

A consequence of this algorithm is that there is no overdraw when drawing the
outer walls of a sector (if defined with @sc{zfill}). The 2D polygon clipping
algorithm takes care of that.  One may think that this algorithm would be
rather expensive but this does not seem to be the case.  So we eliminate
overdraw when drawing all the sectors without having to resort to S-buffer or
other similar techniques.

There is overdraw when inner things are drawn (the ones using @sc{zuse}).
This is difficult to avoid.  One could consider another clipping algorithm
but this would result in concave polygons which our polygon drawer can not
handle.
