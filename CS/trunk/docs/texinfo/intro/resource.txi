The Crystal Space home page contains the latest development and
official releases of Crystal Space.  Here is a small note about the
difference between the official and the development (beta) releases: both
the official and development versions are actually beta.  The difference is
that the official release should be more stable and will be easier to get
working as all documentation and makefiles are up-to-date.  The development
release will probably have more features but it may not work very well on
your particular system, it may not work at all, or you might not be able to
compile it.  But the development release may also work very well.  You never
know.

Crystal Space is being actively developed.  You can download
@emph{bleeding-edge} versions of the project from the @sc{cvs} repository
where the absolute latest copy is stored.  There are two ways to access the
developmental version of the project.

First, you can access the @sc{cvs} repository directly via a @sc{cvs} tool.
Instructions for doing so may be found here:

@uref{http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=649}

Second, you can download a snapshot of the @sc{cvs} repository using @sc{http}
or @sc{ftp}.  Snapshots are generated daily and are accompanied by standard
@samp{diff}-style @dfn{patch} files.

@uref{http://crystal.sourceforge.net/cvs-snapshots/}

@uref{ftp://crystal.sourceforge.net/pub/crystal/cvs-snapshots/}

You can also view the contents of the @sc{cvs} repository online including
all of the historical information and administrative information.

@anchor{Documentation Resources}
Documentation is included with the Crystal Space distribution.  A gateway to
all documentation can be found in the file @file{CS/docs/README.htm}.  You can
also read the @cite{Crystal Space User's Manual} with your web browser by
loading the file @file{CS/docs/html/index.htm}, as well as the @cite{Crystal
Space Public API Reference Manual} by viewing the file
@file{CS/docs/pubapi/index.htm}.

Documentation is also available for online viewing.  The @cite{Crystal Space
User's Manual} is available for online viewing at this location:

@url{http://crystal.sourceforge.net/docs/online/manual/}

The @cite{Public @sc{api} Reference Manual}, for programmers utilizing Crystal
Space, is available for online viewing here:

@url{http://crystal.sourceforge.net/docs/online/pubapi/}

The @cite{Developer's @sc{api} Reference Manual}, for programmers actually
working on Crystal Space itself, is available here:

@url{http://crystal.sourceforge.net/docs/online/devapi/}

In addition, all of the above documents may be downloaded for offline viewing
via @sc{http} or @sc{ftp} from the following locations, and are packaged with
a variety of compression technologies, including @sc{bzip2}, @sc{gzip}, and
@sc{zip}.

@url{http://crystal.sourceforge.net/docs/download/}

@url{ftp://crystal.sourceforge.net/pub/crystal/docs/download/}

@noindent
Currently these documents are only available in @sc{html} format, but may
someday be available as @sc{pdf}, PostScript, and possibly other formats as
well.

Developers can generate their own copies of these manuals from the Crystal
Space source package by invoking certain makefile targets.  The @cite{User's
Manual} can be built as various output formats by invoking any of the targets
@samp{htmldoc}, @samp{psdoc}, @samp{pdfdoc}, and @samp{infodoc}.

The @cite{Public @sc{api} Reference Manual} and @cite{Developer's API
Reference Manual} can be generated in @sc{html} format by invoking the
@samp{pubapi} and @samp{devapi} makefile targets, respectively.

These makefile targets place the generated output in subdirectories of
@file{CS/out/docs}.  The hierarchy of subdirectories mirrors that of
@file{CS/docs} where the master copies of these documents are kept.
