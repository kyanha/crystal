@section A Guide to This Documentation

In this section we guide you through some of the more useful sections of
the documentation related to creating your own project using Crystal
Space.  This guide can help you find the information you want more
quickly, but it is recommended that you scan through the entire
documentation (just browsing the table of contents should be enough) so
that you have a better idea of what is explained where.

One of the most useful sections for creating your own project is of
course the tutorial section (@pxref{Tutorials}). Here you will find six
tutorials which can help you to write your own Crystal Space game along
with the very important introductory tutorial (@pxref{Tutorial 
Introduction}). You should certainly read this if you want to have a
good idea on some of the basic concepts of Crystal Space.

Additionally, the tutorial section contains the @sc{howto} section
(@pxref{HOWTO}).  The @sc{howto}s are small documents explaining how to
solve small problems. They usually contain example code. Most of the
@sc{howto}s are related to solving problems with the Crystal Space
engine (like collision detection, mesh lighting and animation, mesh
movement, loading a level, etc), but there are also two explaining how
you can set up your own application outside of the Crystal Space
application tree (one for Unix/MinGW and another for Microsoft Visual
C++). 

The section of the manual that talks about the engine (@pxref{csEngine})
is very important. If you want to know how the 3D engine works
internally (which is important if you want to build your own 3D worlds)
then you should read the section explaining the world components
(@pxref{World Components}) and the section explaining portals
(@pxref{Portal Engine}). There is a @sc{howto} about render
priorities (@pxref{HOWTO Render Priorities}) which should assist greatly
in that area. 

The section about the Map File Parser (@pxref{csParser}) is useful if
you want to create your map files manually.

The mesh object section (@pxref{MeshObject}) is a recommended read.
Mesh objects are objects that represent geometry in Crystal Space. If
you want to display something in your world you will have to know how to
use them.  The tutorials and @sc{howto}s contain information about mesh
objects but this section contains the complete documentation.
