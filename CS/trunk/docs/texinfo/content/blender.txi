Blender is one of the most popular open source 3D modelers available and can be used
to create models and scenes for Crystal Space. You can find Blender here:

@url{http://www.blender3d.org}

To export your objects into Crystal Space, you will need to use the @code{io_scene_cs}
add-on script. This script is valid for the Blender 2.6x series and above.

If you want to use the Blender 2.4x series, then you should use the @code{blender2crystal}
script instead (available from @url{http://leapingcat.org/blender2crystal})

The @code{io_scene_cs} add-on script is still in Beta stage, although it works quite
well with most objects and scenes. It can export:

@itemize @bullet
@item
static meshes into Crystal Space @ref{MeshObject Genmesh, Genmesh meshes}
@item
animated meshes, along with their skeleton, morph targets, bone influences, animations
and sockets, into Crystal Space @ref{MeshObject Animesh, Animesh meshes}
@item
materials and textures
@item
scenes with multiple sectors (portals are still lacking)
@item
groups of objects as instanced meshes
@end itemize

The following sections will guide you through the installation and usage of this script.
