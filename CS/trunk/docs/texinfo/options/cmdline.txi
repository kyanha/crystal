All Crystal Space applications respond to a common set of command line
options.  Many applications define additional options which are specific
to that particular application.

The most immediately useful command line option which all applications
respond to is @samp{-help}.  This command list all of the other options to
which an application responds.

The default setting for each command line option is set internally in the 
program unless there is a corresponding line for it in the configuration file.  
For example, normally the default for @code{-gamma} is @code{1.0} (the default 
brightness level).  But when @code{GAMMA=2.0} is set in configuration file 
@file{soft3d.cfg} the default will be @code{2.0} instead.  Command line 
options always override default values.  

Some interesting options to play with are:

@table @code
@item -mode=640x480
Use this option to set the size of the display.

@item -video=opengl
(or direct3d, glide, software, ...).
Use this option to select type of display driver to use.  Other options
are @code{software}, @code{glide}, @code{direct3d}, etc.

@item @emph{FIXME}
Document the remaining common command line options.
