@cindex Unix per-user configuration

On unix per-user data is stored in the home directory of the user. CS creates a
hiddern directory named @file{.crystal} there. The actual name of the
configuration file is generated from the @emph{unique application identifier}
with an @file{.cfg} suffix.

The configuration file format is the same as described in
@ref{Configuration File}.
