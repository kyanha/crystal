@subsection Step 7: Updating Crystal Space

@subsubheading Updating Crystal Space with WinCVS --- @sc{pserver}

Once you've successfully checked out the complete source code tree and changes
have been made, you can update your local copy to mirror the latest code on the
@sc{cvs} server.  The steps in this section must be completed every time you do
an update.

Before updating you must login to the server.  From the WinCVS file menu click
on @emph{Admin} then @emph{Login}.  The @emph{Password authentication} dialog
prompt will appear, just click on @sc{ok}.

@end ifnotinfo
In the @emph{Output} window at the bottom of the WinCVS client should appear
the following:

@example
cvs -z4 -q login
(Logging in to anonymous@@cvs.sourceforge.net)
*****CVS exited normally with code 0*****
@end example

If the login was successful, then you can proceed to update.  In the left hand
@emph{Workspace} window, where you can see the directory @file{crystal_space}.
Well now you have a ticked subdirectory @file{CS}.  Right click on that
directory and then click on @emph{Update selection} and the following dialog
box will appear:

@ifnotinfo
@picturess{tutorial,wincvs,wincvs10}

@end ifnotinfo
On the @emph{Update settings} property sheet, edit as shown in the screenshot
below.

@ifnotinfo

@end ifnotinfo
Next click on the property sheet tab @emph{Sticky options} and edit as shown in
the screenshot below.

@end ifnotinfo
Next click on the property sheet tab @emph{Globals} and edit as shown in the
screenshot below.

@ifnotinfo
@picturess{tutorial,wincvs,wincvs13}

@end ifnotinfo
Now just click on the @sc{ok} button and after several seconds you should start
to see the files being updated the server and start appearing in the bottom
@emph{Output} window.

The end of a successful update will be indicated by the line:

@example
*****CVS exited normally with code 0*****
@end example

If the checkout ends with the following line, then the update has failed and
you must repeat the update steps in this section.

@example
*****CVS exited normally with code 1*****
@end example

@subsubheading Updating Crystal Space with WinCVS --- @sc{ssh}

In the left hand @emph{Workspace} window of the WinCVS client, where you can
see the directory @file{crystal_space}.  Well now you have a ticked
subdirectory @file{CS}.  Right click on that directory and then click on
@emph{Update selection} and the following dialog box will appear:

@ifnotinfo
@picturess{tutorial,wincvs,wincvs10}

@end ifnotinfo

This is where an @sc{ssh} update differs from @sc{pserver}.  A blank
@sc{dos}/Command window should have now appeared.  Enter your SourceForge
password or @sc{ssh} key and hit the @kbd{@key{ENTER}} key.  After several
seconds you should start to see the files being updated appearing in the bottom
@emph{Output} window.
