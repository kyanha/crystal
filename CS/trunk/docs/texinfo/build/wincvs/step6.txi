@subsubheading Checking Out Crystal Space with WinCVS --- @sc{pserver}

Before checking out the Crystal Space code you must login to the server.
From the WinCVS file menu click on @emph{Admin} then @emph{Login}.  The
@emph{Password authentication} dialog prompt will appear.  Just click on the
@file{OK} button without entering a password.

In the @emph{Output} window at the bottom of the WinCVS client should appear
the following:

@example
cvs -z4 -q login
(Logging in to anonymous@@cvs.sourceforge.net)
*****CVS exited normally with code 0*****
@end example

If the login was successful, then you can proceed and checkout the Crystal
Space code.  In the left hand @emph{Workspace} window, where you can see the
directory @file{crystal_space} right-click on that directory and then click on
the @emph{Checkout module} menu item and you will be presented with the
following dialog box.

In the edit field @emph{Enter the module name and path on the server}, enter
the word @samp{crystal}.

seeing messages that files are being checked out from the @sc{cvs} server.

If the checkout fails, then you will see the following line and must
repeat the checkout steps in this section.
