@subsubsection Step 2: Installing the Software

This section explains how to install the software which you downloaded in the
previous section.

@subsubheading WinCVS Client

First unpack the downloaded @file{.zip} (e.g. @file{WinCvs120.zip}) to a
temporary location on your hard drive.  Next browse to that temporary location
and execute @file{Setup.exe} to begin the WinCVS installation.  During the
installation process, follow the on screen instructions and complete the
process installing to a location of your choosing on your system.  At the end
of the installation process you will prompted to restart your system.  We
strongly advise you do so, then come back and continue with this guide.

@subsubheading Secure Shell (SSH)

The @sc{ssh} package you have downloaded is a self extracting executable with
its base @file{ssh} directory already in the archive.  Open it and extract to a
location of your choosing.  For the purposes of this guide we will assume you
extracted to your @file{C:\} drive, thus the software resides in @file{C:\ssh}.

Now adjust your @samp{PATH} environment variable.  On Windows 95 and 98 edit
the @file{C:\autoexec.bat} file and add the following entry.  On Windows
@sc{nt} and Windows 2000, use the System control panel to edit the environment
variable.

@example
set PATH=C:\ssh\bin
@end example

Before continuing with this guide.  Windows 95, 98, etc.  users will need to
reboot their systems, to ensure that the previous the changes take effect.
