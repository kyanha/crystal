@node External Libraries, Platform Instructions, Requirements, Building
@section External Libraries

Crystal Space may utilize several external, and publicly available development
libraries.  Those libraries need to be installed on your system before you can
go on with the building of Crystal Space.

Depending on your system, you may refer to the specific page dedicated to the
installation of those libraries:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@ref{cs-winlibs, Windows}
@item
@ref{Debian Libraries, Ubuntu and Debian based systems}
@item
@ref{MacOS/X Libraries, MacOS/X}
@end itemize

This section will cover most of the libraries that may be used by Crystal Space.

If you use @code{configure} for the configuration of Crystal Space, then a
comprehensive list of the libraries is printed at the end of the process,
classified whether they have been found or not.

Here is a first list of the main libraries that are needed by Crystal Space,
and are considered mandatory:

@itemize @bullet
@item
OpenGL
@item
X Window System (only needed for the systems based on it)
@item
@sc{cg}
@item
zlib
@item
libpng
@item
libjpeg
@item
Freetype2
@end itemize

Here is a second list, with the libraries that are highly recommended:

@itemize @bullet
@item
OpenAL
@item
ALSA (only needed for GNU/Linux)
@item
Open Sound System (only needed for UNIX based systems)
@item
Ogg/Vorbis
@item
Assimp
@item
Bullet
@item
@sc{cegui}
@item
wxWidgets
@end itemize

And finally, here is a third list, with the libraries that are considered
optional:

@itemize @bullet
@item
JACK
@item
Speex
@item
libmng and Little CMS
@item
Little CMS (only for some OpenBSD installations)
@item
vgvm, Cairo and Cairomm
@item
Python
@item
@sc{gtk}
@item
Curl
@item
Cal3D
@item
lib3ds
@item
ODE
@end itemize

Most of these libraries are optional.  If you do not have them installed, then
Crystal Space will still function, though features related to the missing
libraries will be disabled.  Despite being optional, at the very minimum, you
should at least ensure that zlib, libpng, and libjpeg are installed since much
useful functionality depends upon those libraries.  Many computer systems come
with these libraries pre-installed.  If the libraries are not already available
on your system, then see the following sections for information about how to
obtain them.

If you need to install some of the libraries yourself pay attention to the
versions states below. 

@itemize @bullet
@item 
``Required'' means that you need to install exactly 
the version stated, otherwise Crystal Space can not use the library. 
@item 
``Recommended'' means that the version stated is known to work well with 
Crystal Space, however, older or newer versions may work as well. If you have
a choice between multiple versions for a library, pick the recommended one.
@item
``Minimum'' means that a library needs to be at least of the version stated,
but newer versions are very likely to work as well and can be chosen.
@end itemize

@subheading OpenGL
@cindex OpenGL
@cindex Libraries, OpenGL

OpenGL is needed to provide accelerated 3D graphics @emph{on all platforms}.

No special effort is usually needed to install the development components on
Windows or MacOS/X, as the various Development Kits for that platform 
generally contain the headers and libraries needed to utilize OpenGL.

For other platforms the exact installation procedure depends on the operating 
system/distribution you're using.  While the runtime components are usually
installed when a graphical desktop is used, development components may 
still have to be.  It is outside the scope of this manual to detail how this 
is done on the various distributions and platforms, please refer to other 
resources for that.

@subheading X Window System
@cindex X Window System
@cindex Libraries, X Window System

This is needed to enable graphical output on a number of Unix-like operating 
systems, most prominently @sc{gnu}/Linux.  It is @emph{not} needed for Windows
or MacOS/X.

The exact installation procedure depends on the operating system/distribution 
you're using.  If you are, what is likely, running a graphical desktop, the
needed runtime components of the X Window System are installed and functioning
on your system.  However, development components (headers and libraries) may 
still have to be installed.  It is outside the scope of this manual to detail
how this is done on the various distributions and platforms, please refer to
other resources for that.

@subheading @sc{cg}
@cindex @sc{cg}
@cindex Libraries, @sc{cg}
@cindex CG library

@emph{Version:} 2.0 minimum

Many Crystal Space shaders require the @sc{cg} library from nVidia.
Crystal Space depends on the @sc{cg} library with version number at least
equal to 1.4. If you're on @sc{gnu}/Linux then you may not find a package
with that version available, in this case you have to directly download this 
from @url{http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cg_toolkit.html#downloads}.
