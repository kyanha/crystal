@section External Libraries

Crystal Space may utilize several optional external, and publicly available
development libraries.  These libraries are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
zlib
@item
libpng
@item
libjpeg
@item
Freetype2
@item
@sc{ode}
@item
Cal3D
@item
lib3ds
@item
Ogg/Vorbis
@item
libmng
@item
MikMod
@item
@sc{cegui}
@end itemize

Most of these libraries are optional.  If you do not have them installed, then
Crystal Space will still function, though features related to the missing
libraries will be disabled.  Despite being optional, at the very minimum, you
should at least ensure that zlib, libpng, and libjpeg are installed since much
useful functionality depends upon those libraries.  Many computer systems come
with these libraries pre-installed.  If the libraries are not already available
on your system, then see the following sections for information about how to
obtain them.

@subheading The ``cs-win32libs'' Package
@anchor{cs-win32libs}

Rather than having to install these components manually, Microsoft Visual C++ 6
& 7, MinGW/MSYS, and Cygwin users can download a single package which contains
all common headers, pre-built library files, and dynamic link libraries in
pre-compiled form from the following location:

@noindent
@ifnottex
@uref{http://www.crystalspace3d.org/support/win32/cs-win32libs-0.99r0_017.exe}
@end ifnottex
@iftex
@code{http://www.crystalspace3d.org/support/win32/}@*
@code{cs-win32libs-0.99r0_017.exe}
@end iftex

@subheading zlib
@cindex zlib
@cindex Libraries, zlib
@cindex Compression library, zlib

Crystal Space relies upon the @code{zlib} library for reading @sc{zip} files,
and for a few other uses.  You can download @code{zlib} from:

@noindent
@uref{http://www.gzip.org/zlib/}

After downloading you can either install the package normally (i.e. @samp{make
install}) or unpack it into the directory @file{CS/libs/zlib*}.  In general, if
you have permission to do so, it is best to install the library.

@subheading libpng
@cindex libpng
@cindex Libraries, libpng
@cindex PNG library

Crystal Space relies upon the @code{libpng} library for reading @sc{png}
graphic files.  You can download @code{libpng} from:

@noindent
@uref{http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html}

After downloading you can either install the package normally (i.e. @samp{make
-f scripts/makefile.std install}) or unpack it into the directory
@file{CS/libs/libpng*}.  In general, if you have permission to do so, it is
best to install the library.

@subheading libjpeg
@cindex libjpeg
@cindex Libraries, libjpeg
@cindex JPEG library

Crystal Space relies upon the @code{libjpeg} library for reading @sc{jpeg}
graphic files.  You can download @code{libjpeg} from:

@noindent
@uref{http://www.ijg.org/files/}

After downloading you can either install the package normally (i.e. @samp{make
install}) or unpack it into the directory @file{CS/libs/jpeg*}.  In general,
if you have permission to do so, it is best to install the library.

@subheading Freetype2
@cindex Freetype2
@cindex Libraries, Freetype2

Crystal Space can utilize the FreeType2 library to display TrueType fonts. You
can get the latest version at:

@noindent
@uref{http://www.freetype.org/}

@subheading @sc{ode}
@cindex @sc{ode}
@cindex Libraries, @sc{ode}
@cindex Physics library

Crystal Space contains a plugin providing physics through @sc{ode}. You can get
the required latest @sc{cvs} code at:

@noindent
@uref{http://www.ode.org/}

@emph{Note:} You @sc{must} compile @sc{ode} with @sc{opcode} support inorder
to use the library with @sc{cs}.

@subheading Ogg/Vorbis libraries
@cindex Ogg/Vorbis
@cindex Libraries, Ogg/Vorbis

With this libraries you can use the Ogg/Vorbis sound plugin. You can get the
latest version at:

@noindent
@uref{http://www.vorbis.com/download.psp}

@subheading libmng
@cindex libmng
@cindex Libraries, libmng
@cindex @sc{mng}/@sc{jng} library
@anchor{GettingLibmng}

Crystal Space can optionally utilize the @code{libmng} library for reading
@sc{mng}/@sc{jng} graphic files.  You can download @code{libmng} from:

@noindent
@uref{http://www.libmng.com/}

After downloading you can either install the package normally (i.e. @samp{make
install}) or unpack it into the directory @file{CS/libs/libmng*}.  In general,
if you have permission to do so, it is best to install the library.
