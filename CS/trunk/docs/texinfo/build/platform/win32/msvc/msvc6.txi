In order to successfully compile the Crystal Space 3D Software Development
Kit (@sc{sdk}), you will need a copy of @emph{Microsoft Developer Studio 6}
or the stand alone version of @emph{Microsoft Visual C++ 6}, with additionally
Service Pack (@sc{sp}) 5 installed.

@subsubheading Getting Extra Help

If you need help with Crystal Space and Visual C++ or just Crystal Space in
general.  You can subscribe and then post a message to the Crystal Space
mailing list.  To subscribe see the following site and fill in the form:

@uref{http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/crystal-main}

Alternatively you can email the Win32 port maintainer directly at the following:

@email{philipwyett@@dsl.pipex.com}.

@subsubheading Required/Optional External Libraries and Software

All the following libraries and Software Development Kits (@sc{sdk}) unless
stated are not required.  However, if you choose not to install them, at
compile time you must follow the documented instructions of how to unload these
projects from the Crystal Space build process.

@subsubheading msvc_libs - Required

Before you attempt to compile Crystal Space, you must download
and install @file{msvc_libs}.  msvc_libs is a package containing all
third party header, pre-built library and dll files used by Crystal
Space, i.e. @file{zlib.dll}, @file{libjpeg.dll}, @file{png.dll} and
@file{xmlparse.dll} etc.  The latest version of the msvc_libs package
@file{msvc_libs_0.95dev002.zip} can be downloaded from:

@noindent
@uref{ftp://ftp.sunsite.dk/projects/crystal/support/win32/msvc_libs_0.95dev002.zip}

@noindent
@uref{ftp://62.188.48.183/support/win32/msvc_libs_0.95dev002.zip}

Once you have downloaded the msvc_libs package, extract it too your @file{CS\}
root directory.

@subsubheading DirectX - Required

In order to compile Crystal Space at its minimum i.e. the software render,
requires you must have at least some form of the DirectX Software Development
Kit (@sc{sdk}) on your system.

@itemize @bullet
@item
DirectX 5.0 or higher is required.  With this, you get sound output and
non-accelerated graphics.
package.

@item
DirectX 6.1 or higher (including DirectX 8a) allows hardware-accelerated 3D
graphics.
@end itemize

Visual C++ 6 comes with the minimum DirectX @sc{sdk} 5 files in-order to build
Crystal Space.

To enable you to build Crystal Space to it's optimum @sc{d3d} support, you must
download the latest DirectX Software Development Kit (@sc{sdk}), which can be
obtained from:

@uref{http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/directx}

If you are unable to accomplish the 100+Mb (For the full @sc{sdk}) or 43Mb (For
the VisualC only parts of the @sc{sdk}) download of the DirectX 8a @sc{sdk}
from the link above.  You can obtain cut down older versions (6 & 7 with no
documents or example code) of the DirectX @sc{sdk}'s from the following
website:

@uref{http://www.multimania.com/noote/CrystalSpace}

Thanks, to the miracle which is Microsoft.  If you download and install the
latest DirectX 8a Software Development Kit (@sc{sdk}) and already have Visual
C++ installed, it will ask you if you wish to add the paths to the @sc{sdk} to
Visual C++ so it can use it.  We recommend you accept when offered this option.
If it is not the latest @sc{sdk} you install you will have to manually point
Visual C++ to where you installed the @sc{sdk} in-order for it to be used.
This can be done from the Visual C++ file menu and selecting
@emph{Tools->Options->Directories}.  You must add the paths for both the
include files and libraries and being that we wish Visual C++ to see and use
this new @sc{sdk} before all possible others on your system, you must click on
and drag both paths you have entered to the top of the list.

@subsubheading Simple Direct Media Layer

Crystal Space contains support for a Simple Direct Media Layer 2D canvas which
can be used as an alternative to the default Direct Draw canvas for use with
the Crystal Space software 3D renderer.  To compile the SDL2D canvas you must
have the supported 1.2.3 development runtime for your version of @sc{msvc} be
it 5 or 6.  Please remeber to add the @file{include} and @file{lib} directories
to the global @sc{msvc} options, so @sc{msvc} can see them.

@uref{http://www.libsdl.org}

Also remember to copy the @file{sdl.dll} into the @file{CS\} root directory
or at it to your systems path before using the SDL2D canvas.

For instructon on using a specific canvas including
the @sc{sdl2d} canvas @ref{Common Command Line Options}

@subsubheading Python

Crystal Space contains support for Python scripting and thus has projects
within it requires that Python be installed on your system. Make sure you add the
Python @emph{include} and @emph{libs} directories too @sc{smvc} so that the compiler
can see those files. If you wish to compile with Python support you must install
Python 1.5.2 or later, which can be obtained from:

@uref{http://www.python.org}

Note: To correctly build the CS Python plugin with Python version later than
1.5.2 in @emph{CS\plugins\cscript\cspythoncs_pyth.cpp'} Now find the code lines
49 - 55 inclusive  i.e.

@example
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" @{
#endif
#include "Python.h"
#ifdef __cplusplus
@}
#endif
@end example

The above @emph{extern "C"} will cause problems because MS put C++ 
template code right in the middle of MSVC's math.h and for that blows 
out some nice errors. To avoid this edit the above to match the 
following.

@example
//#ifdef __cplusplus
//extern "C" @{
//#endif
#include "Python.h"
//#ifdef __cplusplus
//@}
//#endif
@end example

@subsubheading BisonFlex

The Alternate Window System (AWS) plugin will build correctly under MSVC.
However, if you wish to make modifications to it's structure and or lexer, it will
require you re-generate @emph{sllex.cpp, slparse.cpp, slparse.cpp.h and slparse.h}.
If you need todo this will require you have Bison and Flex on your system. The
suggested and supported version can be obtained via the link below.

For Visual C++ 6:

@ifnottex
@uref{http://www.philipwyett.dsl.pipex.com/crystal_space/msvc/downloads/bfwizard-1.6.zip}
@end ifnottex
@iftex
@code{http://www.philipwyett.dsl.pipex.com/crystal_space/msvc/downloads/}@*
@code{bfwizard-1.6.zip}
@end iftex

Install this package to a location of your choice on your system. During the install
process, it will detect MSVC and install itself in the appropraiate directories and
the executables in the system path. We suggest you agree to it's automatic detections. 

@subsubheading Setting up and building the AWS plugin

To re-generate the files mentioned above. Open a @emph{MS-DOS Prompt/Command Prompt} and
navigate to the @emph{CS\} root directory. Next, just enter the command lines listed
below.

@ifnottex
@code{flex -L -Splugins/aws/flex.skl -t plugins/aws/skinlang.flx > plugins/aws/sllex.cpp}
@end ifnottex
@iftex
@code{flex -L -Splugins/aws/flex.skl -t plugins/aws/skinlang.flx >}@*
@code{plugins/aws/sllex.cpp}
@end iftex

@ifnottex
@code{bison --no-lines -d -p aws -o plugins/aws/slparse.cpp plugins/aws/skinlang.bsn}
@end ifnottex
@iftex
@code{bison --no-lines -d -p aws -o plugins/aws/slparse.cpp}@*
@code{ plugins/aws/skinlang.bsn}
@end iftex

Now just follow the @emph{Compiling Crystal Space} instructions to again re-build AWS
with your modifications included.

@subsubheading Creative EAX 2.0

In order to build the CS EAX 2.0 enviromental audio plugin (@emph{plgsndrdreax}), requires
you have the EAX 2.0 SDK on your system. The SDK can be obtained from the following website.

@uref{http://developer.creative.com/LEFTMENU/DC_LM_Downloads.asp}

After installtion you will need to point MSVC to the SDK's include and lib paths.

@subsubheading Compiling Crystal Space

To compile Crystal Space, you'll have to perform the following steps.  If
anything doesn't work, see the Win32 @sc{faq}, @ref{MSVC6 FAQ}.

@enumerate
@item
Load @file{CS\mk\visualc\csall.dsw}.

@item
Remove all projects you don't want to compile.  To do this, right-click on the
project in the list and select @emph{Unload Project}.  Examples of projects
which you don't want to compile might include @samp{plgopengl} if you do not
have the OpenGL @sc{sdk} insatalled, or @samp{plgcspython} if you do not have
the Python @sc{sdk} installed.

@item
Make @samp{grpall} your active project.  This is done by right clicking on it
and then clicking on @emph{Set as Active Project}.

@item
From the file menu selct @emph{Build->Rebuild All} or alernatively hit your
@kbd{@key{F7}} key.

@item
After a while the compilation should finish without error.  The signal for a
successful build will be come in the form of the something similar to the
following:

@example
------------ Configuration: grpall - Win32 Debug ------------

grpall.lib - 0 error(s), 0 warning(s)
@end example
@end enumerate

@subsubheading Running the Demonstration Applications

The first app you should try is Walktest.  This program shows many of the
features of the 3D engine.  You can run it by starting it from the windows
explorer.  It should be at @file{.../cs/walktest.exe}.  Don't start it from
other locations or from within Visual Studio.  It won't find the required files
if you do.

If you want to run a debug session, you first have to set the working
directory.  Open @emph{Project/Settings}, select the appWalktest project,
switch to the @emph{Debug} tab and enter the base @file{CS\} directory as the
working directory for debug sessions (for example, @file{C:\CS\}).  Be sure to
to this for @emph{Debug} and @emph{Release} builds.

You can now continue with the next platform-independent step.  The remaining
Windows-specific sections are only important when you want to compile your own
application using Crystal Space.

@subsubheading Structure of the Workspace

@emph{Note}: If you find bugs in the @sc{msvc} project or workspace files
coming with Crystal Space, don't send fixes for these files to the developers.
These files are generated automatically, so your fixes would be useless.
Better, send a description of the bug to the mailing list.

The Crystal Space workspace is divided into several projects.  They all exist
as separate project files (@file{*.dsp}).  All of them are being bound together
by a workspace @file{csall.dsw}.  This workspace will also ensure correct
linking between the various projects.

The workspace uses a prefix system for naming the projects and grouping them.
There are currently four prefixes in use.  The prefix @file{grp} is used to
group the projects into the three main categories: @emph{libraries},
@emph{plug-ins}, and @emph{applications}.  There is also a special group
@samp{grpall} that contains the three major groups @samp{grplibs},
@samp{grpapps}, and @samp{grpplugins}.

The @emph{Libraries} are C++ libraries that you can link into your own
programs.  Some of these libraries are part of the core of Crystal Space.  You
can find more information about this in @ref{Libraries}.  Their output are
@file{.lib} files.

The @emph{Plugins} are also programming libraries, but they use a special
mechanism called @sc{scf} as their interface to your program.  This separates
their interface from the internals of the library and thus allows dynamic
linking.  In fact, some of the @emph{Libraries} also use @sc{scf}.  The rule
for the @sc{msvc} workspace is simple: The @emph{Plugins} are projects that
build a dynamic library (@file{.dll}).  You can find more information in the
section of this manual dealing with plug-in modules.  @xref{Plug-In Drivers}.

The @emph{Applications} are programs using some of these libraries, so they
produce @file{.exe} files.

@subsubheading Compiling Your Own Program Using Crystal Space

It is assumed that you have set up @sc{msvc} projects before.  If you want to
create a project using Crystal Space, you have two possibilities how to do
this: You can either create the project inside the Crystal Space workspace, or
you can create a new workspace.  Either way, you have to do the usual setup,
like adding the source files.  In addition to this, you must perform the
following steps.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Set the output path to the @file{CS\} root directory.  Any Crystal Space
application must be executed in this directory.  If you want to run it in
another directory, you must copy the files @file{scf.cfg} and @file{vfs.cfg},
the data directory and all plugins (@file{.dll}) into this new directory, or
set the CRYSTAL environment variable to your Crystal Space directory.

@item
Set the include paths.  Simply open one of the application projects coming with
Crystal Space, for example WalkTest, select
@emph{Project Settings/C/C++} and copy all command line options that look like
this: @samp{/I "../../anything"}.

@item
Add the Crystal Space libraries.  If you are using the Crystal Space workspace,
simply add dependencies to the Crystal Space projects.  Otherwise you have to
link to the @file{.lib} files.  To do this, either add these files to the
project like source files or add them as command line options in @emph{Project
Settings/C/C++}.  Note that if you add them like source files, you may wish
to add the release libraries to a @emph{Release} folder and the debug libs to
a @emph{Debug} folder, and disable each of these
(@emph{Project Settings/General}) for the opposite type of build.

@item
Add external libraries (@file{zlib}, @file{libjpeg}, @file{DirectX}, ...).
They can be added just like the Crystal Space libraries, except that you can
not use project dependencies.
@end itemize

@subsubheading Frequently Asked Questions (@sc{faq})
@anchor{MSVC6 FAQ}

This is the list of frequently asked questions for the Win32 port of Crsytal
Space.  Please consult this list if you are having difficulty building or using
the project.

@subsubheading Compilation

@itemize @bullet
@item
Q. @emph{I get errors like the following:}

@example
plugins\video\canvas\ddraw8\i_g2d.h(14) : error C2061:
  syntax error : identifier 'LPDIRECTDRAW7'
plugins\video\canvas\ddraw8\i_g2d.h(16) : error C2061:
  syntax error : identifier 'LPDIRECTDRAWSURFACE7'
@end example

A. You are not using the DirectX @sc{sdk} 8 or higher. Either you have not
installed the correct DirectX @sc{sdk}, or you haven't told @sc{msvc} to use
it instead of the older @sc{sdk} included with @sc{msvc}. Either install the
@sc{sdk} correctly or unload the DirectX 8 related projects.

@item
Q. @emph{Where are the @file{zlib.h}, @file{png.h} and @file{jpeglib.h} files?}

A. Those files are not part of the Crystal Space project, but they are
required to build it.  You must get a version of the following packages, most
of which can be easily found on the Internet.  You can download precompiled
versions of these libraries i.e. @emph{msvc_libs} or grab the source code and
compile it yourself if you prefer.  @xref{External Libraries}.

The resources from these packages should be placed in the following locations.

@example
CS\libjpeg.dll
CS\png.dll
CS\zlib.dll
CS\include\cssys\win32\jconfig.h
CS\include\cssys\win32\jerror.h
CS\include\cssys\win32\jinclude.h
CS\include\cssys\win32\jmorecfg.h
CS\include\cssys\win32\jpeglib.h
CS\include\cssys\win32\png.h
CS\include\cssys\win32\pngconf.h
CS\include\cssys\win32\zconf.h
CS\include\cssys\win32\zlib.h
CS\libs\cssys\win32\libs\zlib.lib
CS\libs\cssys\win32\libs\png.lib
CS\libs\cssys\win32\libs\libjpeg.lib
@end example

Note that the source code package generally already contains the files from the
@file{include} and @file{libs} directories, so you may not have to bother with
them.  The @sc{cvs} repository contains these files as well.

@item
Q. @emph{How can I reduce build times?}

A. Build only the projects you will need. You must build all the Crystal Space
libraries, however those you may not need can be unloaded (Right click on the
project you wish unload from the build process and click on Unload). @emph{Be
very careful when unloading projects as some of Crystal Spaces projects e.g. some
plugins are dependant on others}.

@item
Q. @emph{How can I reduce build sizes?}
A. Build only the projects you will need.
A. Turning off precompiled headers tends to save a large amount of file space
while increasing build times somewhat.
@end itemize

@subsubheading Linking

@itemize @bullet
@item
Q. @emph{Where are the files @file{png.lib} and @file{zlib.lib}?}

A. Just look above at the question about @file{zlib.h} and @file{png.h}.
It's the same problem, and if you have already done what is explained there,
I can't do much for you!

@item
Q. @emph{I've got unresolved symbols.}

A. What kind of symbols?

@itemize @minus
@item
@samp{_png_@dots{}}: That means that you don't link the project with
@file{png.lib}.  Just take a look below where it is explained how to do so.

@item
@samp{_inflate@dots{}} and @samp{_deflate@dots{}}: Well, it seems to your
project lacks @file{zlib.lib}.  The trick is explained just below, so hang on.

@item
@samp{_DirectDraw@dots{}}: Same as above, but for @file{ddraw.lib} (DirectX
component), look below.

@item
Any others: Well, I always have a solution, but this one is more difficult.  It
seems that there is a missing source file in your project.  But the question
is, which source file?  If it isn't obvious by the name of the functions, just
to the following: In the menu @emph{Edit}, select the option @emph{Find in
Files@dots{}}.  Put the name of the function in the field ``Find What'', check
that the ``In Folder'' field content is the Crystal Space source directory and
press @emph{Find}.  You should get a bunch of files, many of them just making a
call to the function.  But there is surely one which contains the definition of
the function.  Look at the position of the file where it is defined, and add it
to the project (menu @emph{Project/Add To Project/Files}).

In order to add (or remove) a library for the link process, invoke the
@emph{Project/Settings/Link} menu item, then select the ``General'' category
tab..  There is a field called ``Object/Library Modules'' that lists all the
libraries added to the project at link time.
@end itemize
@end itemize

OK, now it should link.  So you should have an executable file called
@file{walktest.exe} in your src directory.  Let's run it!

@subsubheading Executing

@itemize @bullet
@item
Q. @emph{I just get a black screen.}

A. When I start @file{walktest} I just get a black screen, maybe with some
text output, but after a few seconds it drops back to the normal windows
screen without an error.

This shouldn't happen any more, because in most cases now, @file{walktest} will
display proper error messages.  Anyway, you should make sure you have set an
appropriate directory set (see above).  Make sure you have specified the map
file in @file{walktest.cfg} as @samp{Walktest.Settings.WorldFile=} (also keep
in mind, that your current directory is, where the executable sits.)

@item
Q. @emph{I get the following (or similar) errors:}

@example
WARNING: could not load plugin
  `crystalspace.graphics3d.software'
WARNING: failed to initialize plugin
  `crystalspace.engine.3d'
FATAL: No iGraphics3D plug-in loaded!
FATAL: No iGraphics2D plug-in loaded!
Error initializing system!
@end example

A. You probably did not compile everything. Compiling only the @file{.exe}
file is not sufficient!  You must also compile all plug-ins you want to use.
In the above example the software renderer is missing.

If you are certain that everything is compiled, make sure your working
directory is set to @file{CS\}.  To do this go to the @emph{Project} menu.
Select @emph{Settings} and go to the @emph{Debug} tab.  Change the debug
executate to @file{X:\CS\appname} where @file{X:} is the drive letter where the
Crystal Space project is installed.  Next set the working directory to
@file{X:\CS}.  Click @sc{ok} and you should be all set.

If after doing this, you are still getting the same error, make sure that you 
have the @file{zlib.dll} installed, the @sc{vfs} plugin is dependent upon it.
@end itemize

@subsubheading Miscellaneous

@itemize @bullet
@item
Q. @emph{My last update did compile, but now I got a new version from the
@sc{cvs} repository and everthing seems to be broken.}

A. When working with Crystal Space, always keep in mind, that this is a
multiplatform project.  So sometimes not all features will work correct on all
platforms.  Sometimes a specific port may even be broken due to changes in
other ports.  Since the introduction of @sc{cvs} (@pxref{CVS}) this is usually
only for a short time, so if you got your version out of @sc{cvs}, it usually
pays off, to post a message describing the problems to the Crystal Space
Mailing List describing you problem and include the exact error messages.  If
you wait a while, this will probably be fixed, or at least be worked around.
@xref{Mailing Lists}.

@item
Q. @emph{I have a problem that you haven't solved here!}

A. Try sending a note to the Crystal Space mailing list and asking your
question there.  @xref{Mailing Lists}.  Be sure to include any pertinent
information, such as the operating system you are using, the compiler, which
version of Crystal Space, and any special configuration information.
@end itemize
