@section Platform Specific Problems

These problems are relevant for both compiling and running.  Crystal Space is
work in progress.  Expect these problems to go away in the future.

@itemize @bullet
@item
With the exception of MacOS/X, all ports of Crystal Space require an 8-bit,
15-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit display to run.  It will @emph{not} work on 24-bit
displays.

@item
OpenGL: If your OpenGL display looks really bad (bad quality of lighting
compared to the software renderer) then you have a card which doesn't support
the desired blending mode @code{2*SRC*DST} that Crystal Space uses.  You can
edit @file{data/config/opengl.cfg} and change the @samp{LightmapMode} option to
@samp{multiply} (which all cards should understand) or any of the other
values.  @samp{multiply} will make everything dark but at least it will look
right.  The @sc{riva} 128@sc{zx} is an example of a card which doesn't support
@code{2*SRC*DST}.

@item
Direct3D: Not currently supported.  (If you would like to write a Direct3D
renderer, please contact us.)
