Once you have built the Crystal Space system and its demonstration applications
you may be eager to test them out.  This section will give you the opprtunity
to do so without forcing you to wade through an over-abundance of explanations.
Later sections will describe options and applications in more detail, but
for now, sit back and have some fun.

The executable for each application and all of its support files must be
located in the same directory.  The map files are generally be placed in the
@file{CS/data} directory, but this not a strict requirement.  Please note that
the map @sc{zip} files should @emph{not} be unpacked.  Crystal Space can read
files directly.

In this example, we will run @samp{walktest}, the quintessential Crystal Space
demonstration program.  To run @samp{walktest} with a specific map you have
two options.  First, you can specify the map name on the command line:

@example
walktest @var{map}
@end example

Replace @var{map} with any map file name which you have downloaded and
placed in your @file{CS/data} directory.  For instance:

@example
walktest flarge
@end example

Your other option is to edit the configuration file @file{cryst.cfg} and set
the @samp{WORLDFILE} variable to the name of the map you wish to use.  For
instance:

@example
[World]
; Start world file
WORLDFILE=flarge
@end example

Note that on most platforms Crystal Space currently only supports 256-color
displays (with a colormap) or 15/16/32-bit truecolor displays, though some
platforms may be more tolerant and implement provide support for additional
display depths.

You can also use other command line parameters when running Crystal Space
applications.  @xref{Common Command Line Options}.  Detailed setup can be done
in the configuration file.  @xref{Configuration File}.  In-game setup can be
done via the console.  @xref{Console}.
