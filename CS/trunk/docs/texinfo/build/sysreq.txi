To utilize Crystal Space you need at least the following resources:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Hardware: A good computer with hardware accelerated graphics is best. What
you really need depends on the situation (the map file). Just try it.

@item
Operating System: One of the supported systems. Currently supported
are: Windows, Unix/Linux, MacOS/X Server, OpenStep, NextStep,
OS/2, BeOS, Irix, MacOS, and MS-DOS.

@item
C++ Development Environment: Crystal Space must be built with a C++
compiler and other standard development tools.

@item
The main Crystal Space package:
In fact you need the compiled library, an example application, and several
drivers (@file{.DLL} or @file{.so} files). The CS package contains the
sources for all of them, which means you must compile everything. This
is explained later.

@item
One or more map files. These can be downloaded from the CS homepage
(@uref{http://crystal.linuxgames.com}). They are ZIP files. Do not unzip
them!  Crystal Space reads ZIP files directly.

@item
The external libraries @code{zlib}, @code{libjpeg} and @code{libpng}.
