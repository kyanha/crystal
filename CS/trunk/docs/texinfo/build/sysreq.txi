To utilize Crystal Space you need at least the following resources:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Hardware: A good computer with hardware accelerated graphics is best. What
you really need depends on the situation (the map file). Just try it.

@item
Operating System: One of the supported systems. Currently supported
are: Windows, Unix / GNU/Linux, MacOS/X, MacOS/X Server, OpenStep,
NextStep, OS/2, BeOS, MacOS/9, and MS-DOS.

@item
C++ Development Environment: Crystal Space must be built with a C++
compiler and other standard development tools.

@item
The main Crystal Space package.  In fact you need the compiled library, an
example application, and several drivers (@file{.DLL} or @file{.so} files).
The Crystal Space package contains the sources for all of them, which means you
must compile everything.  This is explained later.

@item
One or more map files.  These can be downloaded from the Crystal Space
homepage.  They are @sc{zip} archives.  Do not unzip them.  Crystal Space reads
@sc{zip} archives directly.
