@appendixsec Portions of Crystal Space Covered Under Different Licenses

Some portions of CrystalSpace are @emph{not} covered by @sc{lgpl} license. You
might have to consider this, depending on how you intend to distribute your
finished product. However, this is usually not problematic, as the modular 
design of CrystalSpace allows to simply exclude the plugins in question.
