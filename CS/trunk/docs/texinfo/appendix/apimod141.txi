@strong{Fixes that apply to tickets in Trac:}

@itemize @bullet

@item
Ticket #737: Projects created by @file{jamtemplate}/@file{createproject.sh} now take @code{MSVC_VERSION} into account when linking against @sc{cel} libraries.

@item
Ticket #803: Don't use a deprecated @file{libpng} function.

@item
Ticket #805: Fix problem where @code{csTinyXmlDocument::Parse(iDataBuffer*)} overload did not ensure that string passed to @code{Parse(const char*)} overload was null-terminated.

@item
Ticket #810: Fix OpenGL context-related build erorr on Snow Leopard by taking advantage of @sc{api} available since 10.3 rather than employing hack needed by earlier versions.

@item
Ticket #811: Fix @emph{cannot convert size_t to UInt32} compilation error on Snow Leopard where @code{size_t} is now 64-bit by default rather than 32-bit.

@item
Ticket #812: Fix leak reported in oggstream2. @code{ov_clear} must be called when the ogg stream is no more needed according to vorbis documentation. It seems as a result leaks reported by openal have disappeared. patch by agy.

@item
Ticket #813:

Fix problem where version number was appended to the executable name at @file{jam install} time on Windows without regard for file extension (i.e. @file{foobar.exe-1.9}) rather than being inserted just before the extension (i.e. @file{foobar-1.9.exe}).

Fix problem where symbolic-link creation failed on Windows at @file{jam install} time when linking non-versioned to versioned executable name.

@item
Ticket #817: Update @sc{cs} repository @sc{url} to latest format specified by SourceForge.

@item
Ticket #895: Cherry picked doc updates. Many thanks to darkenor for taking the time to make the submission.

@strong{Other changes:}

@itemize @bullet
@item
Removal of special autoresume code when unpausing on Mac OS X as multiple consecutive @code{NSApplicationDidResignActiveNotification} messages may be sent causing the app to permanently freeze.

@item
Set @code{CS_CONFIGDIR} for @sc{vfs}.

@item
Change Bullet configure test to look for (apparently) new-style @code{BulletCollision -lLinearMath} as well as previous @code{-lbulletcollision} and @code{-lbulletmath}.

@item
Moved @file{Python.h} @code{_DEBUG} hack into it's own file.

@item
Fixed release mode compile errors in cspython.

@item
Fixed usage of m4_default in call to @code{CS_CHECK_PROG_VERSION} to work with the now stable interface tested on @file{autoconf} 2.66 and 2.67

@item
Relocated @sc{posix} dl-based @file{libs/csutil/unix/loadlib.cpp} to @file{libs/csutil/generic} since it should be portable to various @sc{posix} platforms.
  
Genericized @file{libs/csutil/generic/loadlib.cpp} to allow platform-specific file extensions (@file{.csplugin}/@file{.so}) to be specified at compile time.
  
Retired the Mac OS X specific dynamic module loading facilities in favor of @file{libs/csutil/generic/loadlib.cpp}.  This is possible since Mac OS X supports @sc{posix} @file{dl} facilities, unlike ancestors NextStep, OpenStep, Rhapsody from which the OS X port arose. In addition to reducing Mac OS X specific implementation, this also resolves Apple deprecation warnings from the Darwin module-loading @sc{api}.

@item
Fix wrongly placed @code{break}.

@item
Fix a wrong data size validation check. Spotted by Lirrec.

@item
Remove redundancy.

@item
1.4 requires @sc{cegui} 0.5 but is known to work with 0.6. 1.4 will not compile with @sc{cegui} 0.7.x.

We don't want bug reports about this on such an old release and the work involved in changes to 1.4 to now support 0.7 is not really worth it.

Added test for versions greater than 0.6 of @sc{cegui}, so it fails the 1.4 @file{configure} test.

@item
Add arm support.

@item
Disable Java build.

@item
Removed @file{csdemo} from the default build.

This is due to the @file{demodata.zip} file no longer being available.
Code has been left in place for review and learning purposes.
Removed @file{csdemo} from @file{startme} application list.
Updated docs to indicate the above.

@item
Documented options for running @file{phystut} with preferred physics plug-in more explanatory.
