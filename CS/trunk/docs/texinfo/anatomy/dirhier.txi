@emph{Written by Thomas Hieber, @email{thieber@@gmx.net}.}

This section is intended to explain the general CS directory structure. It
contains all directories, so maybe some will be missing, if you just
downloaded the files for a specific port like Linux or Win32.

Crystal Space consists of the following directories:

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------------
@c Most directories should get a very short note and a link to their real
@c documentation.
@c --------------------------------------------------------------------------
@table @code
@item CS
The main directory for Crystal Space.  You can choose any path for it, as long
as it is supported by your operating system.  This is the path that all
compiled programs end up in.  This should be your working directory for these
executables.  Configuration files (@file{.cfg}) also reside here.

@item CS/apps
This is where all applications which ship with Crystal Space reside.
@xref{Applications}.

@table @code
@item CS/apps/tests
Applications for testing specific features of the project reside here.
@end table

@item CS/bin
Some scripts to support the build process on various platforms.

@item CS/data
Here you should place your levels like @file{large.zip}. You can use any
directory for this, so this is only a suggestion. If you change the name, you
must update the information in the configuration for the Virtual File System,
(@file{vfs.cfg}).

@item CS/docs
The root of the Crystal Space documentation hierarchy.  There are several
subdirectories.

@table @code
@item CS/docs/texinfo
Texinfo is the master format for all Crystal Space documentation.  This
directory and its subdirectories contain all of the Texinfo source and images
which comprise the Crystal Space manual.  Most users need not concern
themselves with this directory since the Texinfo documentation is
automatically converted to @sc{html} which is more accessible to the general
user.  Documentation writers and maintainers may be interested in this
directory.

@item CS/docs/html
This directory contains the @sc{html} conversion of the Texinfo Crystal Space
documentation.  Most users will want to look at @file{CS/docs/html/index.htm}
which resides here.

@item CS/docs/incoming
This is a temporary staging area for documentation which has not yet been
converted to Texinfo format.  Much of this documentation is useful and worth
perusing.
@end table

@item CS/include
Here are the headers that can be used from other modules. The path for the
headers reflect the structure of the modules in the lib directory. So for
furter explanation of a specific directory see the @file{CS/lib} section.

@item CS/libs
Here are all Modules provided be Crystal Space. Some modules will consist of
only one subdirectory in libs, some will be a combination of several
subdirectories.

@table @code
@item CS/libs/cs2d
The 2D driver component which manages creation of the Crystal Space window
used for rendering and also supports limited 2D drawing capabilities
(including 2D pixmaps).  It can be used standalone but it is currently very
limited and not very useful (may change in the future).  There are several
implementations of this component.  All are specific to some 3D Rasterizer
(for example, the OpenGL 3D Rasterizer on Unix requires the OpenGL 2D XLib
Driver).

@end table

@item CS/libs/cs3d
The 3D rasterizer component is required by the 3D engine but may also be
useful standalone.  It needs a 2D Driver.  There are currently several classes
of this component which correspond to particular @sc{api}s: software, OpenGL,
Glide, and Direct3D.  Some rasterizers are operating system independent, such
as OpenGL and software.  Some rasterizer techonolgy is only available on
certain operating systems, such as DirectX.

@end table

@item CS/libs/csengine
The 3D engine is one of the corner stones of Crystal Space and also what
originally sparked the birth of the Crystal Space project.  It needs the 3D
rasterizer component to display output and also requires a number of other
libraries (csutil, csgeom, csgfxldr).  The 3D engine exports a number of
@sc{scf} interfaces to allow access through the @sc{scf} mechanism.

@item CS/libs/csgame

creating a real game.  You can think of it, as an easier way to use Crystal
Space in your own games, at the cost of some flexibility.

@item CS/libs/csgeom
The geometry library.  Various geometry related functions and classes can be
found here: matrices, vectors, @sc{bsp} trees, clipper, planes, etc.

@item CS/libs/csgfxldr

formats and put them internally in the same format.  This library supports
@sc{jpg}, @sc{gif}, @sc{tga}, @sc{png}, and @sc{bmp}.

Network drivers.  The only existing driver is a @sc{bsd} socket-based
@sc{tcp/ip} driver.

@item CS/libs/csobject
Hierarchy of Crystal Space independant classes, that are used as base for most
Crystal Space classes.  The main use for these classes is a system for
run-time type information and for management of attributes like names that can
dynamically be attached to objects at run-time.

@item CS/libs/csparser
A library which parses @sc{ascii} world files and imports the world into the
3D engine.

@item CS/libs/csscript

powerful and needs to be replaced by something better.  However, it is still
used by some of the current levels.
