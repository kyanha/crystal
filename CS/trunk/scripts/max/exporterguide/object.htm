<h3> Objects Properties</h3>
<p>There are a number of supported CS properties that you can set in 3dsmax. Some 
  are based on the naming convention others are defined as properties of the object 
  in 3dsmax. To set a property in 3dsmax just select the object and right-click 
  to open the object menu. Select "Properties...", then the tab "User Defined". 
  In that window you can add the properties of the object. Be sure to use same 
  case, properties are case sensitive.</p>

      it seems that Dynavis works better if you keep that face and set it as invisible. 
      So Dynavis will consider the object closed, and you will have the same visual 
      effect. To set a face as invisible, create a new material with texture "csinvisible.tga" 
      (this IS case-sensitive) and assign it to the faces you want to be invisible.

        cannot have one object with one alpha texture and another non-alpha texture.</p>
      <p>WARNING 2: if the object is a genmesh or thingmesh, then you should not 
        name it _f_t_ or _g_t_ because that's not supported. Name it _f_ or _g_ 
        as usual and then add a property TRASPARENT on it.</p>
      <p>If an object has a transparent texture, CS must be aware of that. To 
        give this information to CS you have to name all transparent objects with 
        a "_t_" prefix. Example: _t_glass01. This is the name of Max object. There 
        is no problem in setting a different name for the texture. </p>
