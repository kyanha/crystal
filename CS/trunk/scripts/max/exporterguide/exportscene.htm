<p>Select PlaneShift-&gt;Export Level.</p>
<p>This is the export dialog:</p>
<p><img height="273" width="303" src="pictures/3dsMaxExporters_img1.gif"></p>
<p><b>Export Level To:</b> In the first field you should specify the export filename 
  including its full path. Ex.: d:\myStuff\CS\levels\level1\world.txt</p>
<p><b>Scale:</b> This indicates which is the scale to apply to the current scene 
  while exporting, if you follow the guideline of "1 meter = 1 generic unit" you 
  can place "1" in this field.</p>
<p><b>Export!</b>: This button starts the export.</p>
<p><b>Copy textures to dest dir:</b> If you check this option, a new dir will 
  be created in the same dir of the output file and will be called &lt;filename&gt;textures. 
  In this directory there will be copied all the textures files present in the 
  scene (the ones used by objects). Multimaterials are supported.</p>
<p><b>Generate Fake lights for walktest:</b> If you check this option, the exporter 
  will add to the world file generated also some animations used to test the day/night 
  setting of all lights present in the level. If you check this option you must 
  add a value in the next field.</p>
<p><b>Duration (msecs):</b> tells the exporter how much time each hour (1 frame=1 
  hour in max) will last in the fake light simulation.</p>
<p><br>
  Rename the generated file as "world" and copy it and the textures in the directory 
  you just created. <br>
  Open a console , cd to your directory (typing cd /the/path/to/CS ) and run "walktest 
  /this/data/my_scene_name -relight" </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<br>
You might need to convert some <a href="object.htm">objects</a> to editabe meshs 
and define your scene as a 24 or 48 frames scene before exporting. <br>
If you dont want to mind with the 24 frames export , and just need a preview of 
a static scene using walktest : Open the genered file with notepad or so , go 
to the end of it,then delete evrything between the &lt trigger&gt...&lt /triggers&gt 
and &lt sequences&gt...&lt /sequences&gt tags <br>
Don t forget to use a target camera for setting starting point and give and add 
roomname in the file properties( forgeting this one would prompt you for an error 
anyway ) <br>
Once all is finished you might want to add <a href="various.htm">portals and rendering 
priorities</a> <br>
Don t forget to enclose all your scene into a skydome or somthing like this and 
add some light in order to avoid display gliches <br>
If u can t see anything , try changing the scall factor from 0.01 to 0.1 , as 
the camera place correspond to the emplacement of your "feet" in the walktest 
and your starting point of view "eyes" may be stuck into a wall or the skydome 
when loading
