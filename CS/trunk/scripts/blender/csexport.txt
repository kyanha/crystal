Some info on using csexport.py plugin.

This Script is written for Blender 2.14, if you are using an older version
please download the new version.

At first put the script (csexport.py) into the subdirectory "python" of the
Blender-dir. This is the dir where all plugins are. Then create the .ani
files for every Blender-Object. The name of the object can be edited in the
field "OB:xxxx" near the middle of the screen. For a simple Crystal
Space-export you can delete the lights, the camera and all Planes
(Planes.001 or so).

The .ani files have the name of the Blender-Object with the extension ".ani".
Just put the ACTION statements for the object into the file. For example an
.ani file could contain the follwing:
    ACTION 'default' (F(f0,1000))

This means the exported object has only one frame, e.g. no animation.

An .ani file for an animation could look so:
	ACTION 'default' (F(f0,1000))
	ACTION 'walk' (F(f0,100) F(f1,100) F(f2,100) F(f3,100) F(f4,100)
		F(f5,100) F(f6,100) F(f7,100) F(f8,100) F(f9,100) F(f10,100))

It is necessary  that there are no spaces except between the F statements.
Put all this file in the Blender-Dir. Next open your Scene in Blender.
Press Shift-F11 in the main window and the script screen will appear.
Now press Alt-Shift-F. Select Open. Now Select the csexport.py in the
File-Requester and open it. To execute the script press Shift-Alt-P.
Errors in execution are shown in the Blender-Textconsole.
