This is 0.02 of blender to cs converter. It only does sprites, and
things and junk and stuff :P 

Put the scripts in blenderdir/scripts/

Open up a model, select a mesh you want to save, press shift F11.

Load the script, and press ALT p to run it.

There should be two files created: athing, and asprite.

todo: clean up code... thing code sucks. 
Do animations for sprites.
Get the texture name for the object. 
Use the name of the object in blender to name the cs objects. 
Replace string = string + extrabit fer spped.
