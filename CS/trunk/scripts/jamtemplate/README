The script in this directory, can create a basic buildsystem (jam based) for
external CS projects. It sets up jamrules, autoconf macros, a configure script,
a source directory and a simple main.cpp file.

To run the script change to some directory where you want to have the project
created and make sure you've setup the CRYSTAL environment variable. Then just
invoke the script. Example:

  $CRYSTAL/scripts/jamtemplate/createproject.sh
