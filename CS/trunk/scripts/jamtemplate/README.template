2. Building and installing

2.1 Jam

 The build system is based on jam. If you don't have jam installed yet, then
 check your distribution for a jam package or get the source directly and
 compile/install jam yourself. You can find the source here:

    ftp://ftp.perforce.com/pub/jam/

 You'll need at least jam version 2.4.

2.2 Building

 0. cd into the source directory
 1. Run "./configure" with some options if you wish. You get a list of possible
   options when you invoke configure with --help
 2. Run "jam"

2.3 Installing

 0. Build the project
 1. Make sure you have write permissions to the install directories. On
    unix/linux this usually means that you have to be the root user.
 1. Run "jam install"
