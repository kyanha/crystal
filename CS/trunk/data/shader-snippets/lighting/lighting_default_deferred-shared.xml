	Weak aliases.
	"Weak" means they do _not_ override aliases specified above this
	snippet; instead, the weak alias applies only if an alias with the
	given has not been specified yet.
	The practical effect is that this allows to use aliased snippets,
	but also provide "default" snippets and thus does not require users
	of this snippets to provide all aliases.

	Snippets - the building blocks of this shader.
	Their order influence what happens if not all features of the shader
	are supported; for earlier appearing snippets higher techniques
	are preferred. Basically, order snippets by 'importance' of the eye
	candy they produce: in this case, we consider good ambient (which
	does static normal mapped light mapping) and static specular more
	important than a parallax effect.
