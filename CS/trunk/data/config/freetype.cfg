; General notes about font sets.
;
; 1. All paths are VFS paths. Since VFS paths are system-independent, there
; is no need to create separate font sets for every OS.
;
; 2. Since FreeType library can handle only "real" files, the VFS paths
; should map to "real" directories rather than to archives. Failing to do so
; will result in failure to load font files.
;
; 3. Fonts starting with an asterisk, '*', are considered "built-in" fonts,
; thus are preloaded at font server startup. There is not anything specific
; about them except that several preloaded fonts (see ifontsrv.h file) are
; expected by most applications to be always available. Other than that, you
; can give any other names starting from '*' to fonts that you want to load
; at startup.
;
; 4. When you call iFontServer::LoadFont() the font server first of all looks
; in the current font set (in the LEFT column) for given "file name". If it
; finds one, the corresponding font is loaded. Otherwise, the file name is
; used as-is. You can have as much aliases as you wish refering to same TTF
; file. The trick is that only the "real" filename really identifies the font;
; all aliases are always resolved into "real" filenames before any comparisons
; happens.
