; All the entries that start with "Device.Joystick." followed by the platform
; name (e.g. "Unix", "Win32", "MacOS/X") are probed. The remainder of the key
; name following "Device.Joystick.{platform}." is arbitrary, but must be unique
; per key. (We use a numeric suffix here, but the numeric does not actually
; define the joystick's number; only the order of entries does.)  The first
; joystick actually discovered on the host corresponds to the first joystick
; seen by the driver; the second discovered joystick corresponds to the second
; joystick seen by the driver, etc. Entries which do not equate to actual
; joysticks on the host are not assigned joystick numbers by the driver.  The
; value after the "=" describes the joystick device.
