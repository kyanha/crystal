; All the entries that start with "Device.Joystick." followed by the platform
; name (e.g. "Unix", "Win32", "MacOS/X") are probed. The remainder of the key
; name after "Device.Joystick.Platform." is arbitrary, but must be unique per
; key. The first entry found for a platform corresponds to the first joystick,
; the second key to the second joystick, etc. (We use a numeric suffix here,
; but the numeric in the suffix does not actually define the joystick's number;
; only the order of entries does.) The value after the "=" describes the actual
; joystick device.
