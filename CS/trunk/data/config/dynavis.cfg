; The number of times to reduce the coverage buffer relative to the
; size of the screen. If this value is set to 0 then the coverage buffer
; will use the same size as the screen. If set to 1 then the coverage
; buffer dimensions will be halfed (i.e. 320x240 for a 640x480 screen).
; Note that using higher values here will make Dynavis overhead less
; but it can also introduce culling errors. Note that using a smaller coverage
; buffer does not always make the end result faster. The tiles will be bigger
; (relative to screen size) so this may be a negative factor. However it
; is probably good to use ReduceCoverageBuffer = 1 if the display size
; is bigger.
