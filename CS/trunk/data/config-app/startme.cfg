StartMe.3.desc.0 = This is a demonstration of the new animated mesh for skeletal animation.
StartMe.3.desc.1 = It shows how animation nodes can be combined to create dynamically
StartMe.3.desc.2 = complex animations. There are three different scenes in this demo,
StartMe.3.desc.3 = press 'n' to switch to the next one.

StartMe.6.desc.0 = Crystal Space is a real 3D engine. However with some tweaking you
StartMe.6.desc.1 = can force it into emulating something that resembles isometric
StartMe.6.desc.2 = a bit. This example also uses stencil shadows.

StartMe.7.name   = imptest
StartMe.7.exec   = imptest

StartMe.7.desc.0 = This is a demonstration of the impostor system. What you see are
StartMe.7.desc.1 = not 3D objects, but 2D objects generated automatically from the
StartMe.7.desc.2 = 3D objects, and updated accordingly to the movements of the camera.
StartMe.7.desc.3 = Used properly, this system can allow to display a great amount of
StartMe.7.desc.4 = objects in the screen at the same time.

StartMe.8.name   = terrain
StartMe.8.exec   = walktest
StartMe.8.args   = -silent terrain -mode=800x600
StartMe.8.desc.0 = This is WalkTest with the terrain map. It demonstrates the landscape
StartMe.8.desc.1 = engine in Crystal Space. There are two versions of this map. This one
StartMe.8.desc.2 = is 'terrain' which looks nice but needs good hardware to run nicely.
StartMe.8.desc.3 = 'terrainf' is a lot faster.

StartMe.9.desc.0 = This is WalkTest with the terrainf map. It demonstrates the
StartMe.9.desc.1 = landscape engine in Crystal Space. There are two versions of this
StartMe.9.desc.2 = map. This one is 'terrainf' which is usually faster then 'terrain'
StartMe.9.desc.3 = and doesn't require advanced 3D hardware. 'terrainf' also
StartMe.9.desc.4 = demonstrates the foliage generator (which slows it down again).
