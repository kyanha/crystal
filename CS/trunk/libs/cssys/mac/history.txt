Things to Do:

Add InputSprocket support.
Add SoundSprocket support.
Add Hardware Accelleration. (RAVE)
Add Network support.
Optimize everything.

History:
17-May-99
	- Adding support for OpenGL.
14-May-99
	- Updating to source in CVS.
5-May-99
	- Updated to v13r010.
	- Move zlib, libjpeg and libpng into the cryst folder to be the same as other platforms.
	- Fixed the access paths, hopefuly this will work for all.
26-Apr-99
	- Updated the Glide Render to v13r009.  Everything else just compiles and works.
20-Apr-99
	- Enabled DrawSprockets and cleaned up the code.
	- Updated to v13r008
12-Apr-99
	- Added a new project for building a library for the Crystal Space Windowing System.
	- Updated to v13r007
26-Mar-99
	- More changes to the sound system.
	- Updated to v13r004
25-Mar-99
	- Got the sound system to work again.  Removed the project Sound and created
	  two more SoundDriver and SoundDriverNull
	- Added a new project that builds all of the shared libraries and CSRegSvr.
	- Renamed Network.prj to NetworkDriverNull.prj.
	- Renamed NetworkMgr.prj to NetworkMgrNull.prj.
23-Mar-99
	- Combined the file fopen.c and char_io.c into libOverrides.c
	- Created csSharedLibrary.exp and removed all other .exp files as they were the same
	  as each other.
	- Added a new project SoundRenderNull for the null sound renderer.
	- Updated to v13r003
5-Mar-99
	- Found a problem when the cfg files are not in mac text format.  Added the file char_io.c
	  to all projects that use the MSL libraries which overrides fgets to handle lines
	  ending in unix,mac and dos formats.
4-Mar-99
	- Wrote a new version of CSRegSvr which is more mac like.  You can drop the shared
	  libraries on it to register them or use the register and unregister menu items
	  in the file menu.
	- Updated the changes to the glide renderer to bring it up to date.  Put the new copy
	  on the web site.
26-Feb-99
	- Found a crash in tcache.cpp,  It was trying to delete a null pointer.
	  Unable to compile inifile.cpp, fixed it by puting parens around a variable that
	  was being cast.  Updated the cswstest.prj projects because the interpert 
	  dos and unix paths flag was turned off and the application size was too small.
25-Feb-99
	- Trying to get 8 bit color working again for build 57.  Fixed up MacSystem so the update
	  window and mouse moved events are handled correctly.  Still having trouble with the palette.
22-Feb-99
	- Fixed up MacDriver2d.cpp for build 57.  Someone changed removed a parameter for
	   initialization.
15-Feb-99
	- Revised the projects for the shared libraries to not need the MSL C and C++ DLLs.
11-Feb-99
	- Fixed up MacDriver2d.cpp for build 54.  Someone changed the guid.
9-Feb-99
	- Renamed this file to history.txt.  Added a copy of the installation document into
	  the maclib folder and renamed it install.txt.
	- Renamed Driver2D.cpp to MacDriver2D.cpp to stop problems when creating hardware
	  rasterizers that have files with the same name.
	- Fixed MacGraphics.cpp to handle 32 bit pixels and updated the Driver2D.proj and
	  SftRndr.prj for these changes.
4-Feb-99
	- Found out why the destructors are not being called for Driver2D.  csGraphics2DMac was
	  implemented as an UNKNOWN_NODELETE while it should be an UNKNOWN.  I don't understand
	  the use of one over the other but UNKNOWN does destruction while UNKNOWN_NODELETE does not.
	  The other part is a fix in world.cpp to release the use of the halo rasterizer after
	  it is done being used.
3-Feb-99
	- Added a new project, NetworkMgr.prj and made sure it and Network.prj are in
	  every application project.
	- Warning! The name of the network shared library was changed from Network.shlb
	  to netdrvn.shlb
2-Feb-99
	- Fixed the support for DrawSprocket in MacGraphics.cpp.
	  Left the define in MacPrefix.h turned off for now.
	- The destructor is not being called for Driver2D.  This is
	  why the monitor settings are never being reset to the
	  original values.  Moved the code from the destructor to
	  the close routine in MacGraphics.cpp.
	- Updated more projects.
1-Feb-99
	- Started this history file.
	- Added in sound support.
	- Modified the projects to interpret DOS and Unix paths.
	  Reduced the number of redirected include files to 3.
	  malloc.h which the mac does not have, sys/stat.h and sys/types.h.
	- Fixed a crash in MacGraphics.cpp when DoubleBuffer was called before Open.
