<h2><a name="#about"></a>What it's about</h2>

I'm making a multiplayer action role-playing game.
Currently this application just tests a few ideas:
<ul>
<li>multiple views for split-screen play
<li>sky box / environment map / background
<li>animated 3d characters
</ul>

<h2><a name="#bugs"></a>Known Bugs</h2>

<ul>
<li>Converting 24 bit images to 8 bit palettes is <em>very</em>
slow and TXTMODE=24bit doesn't work for non-lightmapped polygons.
The skybox uses 24 bit JPEG images again so it takes a <em>long</em>
time to start in 16 or 8 bit.
<li>Floating point exceptions in PreparePolygonFX, pol2d.cpp,
lines 169 and 173.
<li>Edges of sky box polygons visible because of sloppy texture
alignment code that allows some wrapping of the non-tiling textures.
<li>Some sprite polygons vanish when they cross the view plane.
</ul>

<h2><a name="#history"></a>History</h2>

<h3>September 29, 1999 Seth Galbraith and Eric Sunshine</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alternate configuration using the -cfg option
<li>Sprites can now be loaded from the data/squawk folder
</ul>

<h3>September 28, 1999 Seth Galbraith</h3>
<ul>
<li>Environment models in .mdl format by Ulrich Galbraith
<li>New skybox textures (ugly, meant to be temporary)
<li>configurable view layout (see squawk.cfg)
<li>configurable sky textures (see squawk.cfg)
</ul>

<h3>September 27, 1999 Seth Galbraith</h3>
<ul>
<li>gravity flag controls whether a view rotates around the world's Y axis
<li>enabled lighting for some sprites
<li>changed the FOV of each view
<li>added _control87 commands to disable some FPU exceptions
<li>version 17
</ul>

<h3>September 26, 1999 Seth Galbraith</h3>
<ul>
<li>A lot of restructuring
<li>Replaced CS sprite with three .mdl format models
<li>Changed fixed-size arrays into csVector subclasses
<li>Created sqkView class which contains multiple csViews
<li>version 16
</ul>

<h3>September 21, 1999 Seth Galbraith</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jorrit fixed the bug where texture projection was always
centered around the middle of the screen
<li>I merged squawk.txt and history.txt into this document
<li>Changed "room" to "skybox" throughout squawk.cpp
<li>Added AddViewVertex method that takes relative coordinates
<li>two views are now always linked like a single concave view
<li>the other views are now always independent
<li>version 15
</ul>

<h3>September 17, 1999 Seth Galbraith</h3>
<ul>
<li>centers of views adjusted depending on whether the views are linked
<li>replaced sky box textures with big 512x512 JPEG images
<li>version 14
</ul>

<h3>September 4, 1999 Seth Galbraith</h3>
<ul>
<li>converted all textures to 8 bit PNG format
<li>disabled lighting and mipmapping for the sky box
<li>version 13
</ul>

<h3>August 25, 1999  Seth Galbraith</h3>
<ul>
<li>load and display an animated 3d sprite
<li>version 12
</ul>

<h3>August 4, 1999  Eric Sunshine</h3>
<ul>
<li>fixed problem with handling of texture manager; was allocating palette prior
  to world->Prepare(), whereas it should have allocated done after
<li>console now latches palette colors before and after world has been prepared;
  thus allowing it to be used at any time, rather than only prior to world
  preparation
<li>background is now erased prior to activation of 3D views in order to clear
  away console text which incorrectly appeared in gaps between views
<li>version 11
</ul>

<h3>July 29, 1999  Seth Galbraith</h3>
<ul>
