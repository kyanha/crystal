This version of CS has a new feature called octree/c-buffer
visibility culling. This feature is not fully ready yet but it
is already possible to use it.

This kind of visibility culling is ideal for large sectors which
are difficult to portalize or would generate an excessive amount
of portals. What you have to do is to create one large sector
which is convex. Mostly it will probably be a skybox or skydome
type sector with no other geometry on the sector itself. Then
you add all entities (like buildings, rooms, and other static
geometry) as normal things. You can add as many as you want. All
things that you add will be considered static geometry and added
to the octree. If you don't want that to happen for some things
(for example because they can move around) then you should add the
MOVEABLE() keyword to those things.

If you defined your sector then add the STATBSP() keyword somewhere
in the definition of the sector.

This should be it. Now you have to do a little modification to CS.
This is because the current version of CS doesn't use the right
collision detection system yet for moving around. If you don't do
this modification then moving around will be extremely slow.
Edit libs/csengine/camera.cpp and go to the csCamera::MoveWorld()
function. Edit it so that it looks as follows:
    void csCamera::MoveWorld (const csVector3& v)
    {
      csVector3 new_position = GetOrigin () + v;
      //if (sector)
        //sector = sector->FollowSegment (*this, new_position, mirror);
      SetOrigin (new_position);
    }
In other words: add the two comments.
Note that this will prevent CS from properly walking through portals
so don't forget to change this again when going back to portal levels.

Now you can start your level. Warning! This might be very slow if you
added a lot of lights. Lighting currently also doesn't use the new
octree yet so lighting is still extremely slow.

At some point CS will start up hopefully. If all goes well things should
be very slow :-)  This is normal. The optization is not yet enabled
by default. Press the 'd' key and you SHOULD get a significant speed
increase.
