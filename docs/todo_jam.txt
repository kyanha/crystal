This is a list of things which should be solved in the jam based buildsystem.

H - High Prioriy (important showstopper)
M - Medium Priority
L - Low Priority (only minor function loss)
W - Wishlist (the build also works without this feature)

[L] Improve hanlding of rc files on win32. jam should now about them and you
    should be able to specify them like normal source files. (Caveats:
    mingw/cygwin only allow 1 rc file per plugin/application, creating a
    correct version resource file is hard when doing it purely in jam, but I
    don't want to rely on external shell scripts)
[H] external projects on win32 and macosx shouldn't fail. The problem here is
    that the shell scripts in libs/cssys/win32 and libs/cssys/macosx aren't
    there in external projects. Should we collect scripts which are used by
    the build system or should we try to avoid these in the jambuild (these 2
    scripts can probably be solved by improving the jamrules)
[L] MacOSX rules should be aware of the struture of an application wrapper
    instead of using external shell scripts for generating them. Probably we
    also want some rules to add additional stuff into the application wrappers.
[L] rework static plugin linking: This should not be a mode, and the
    intelligence should not be globally put into the Application and Plugin
    rules. Rather the Plugin rules should create a 2nd target where they
    compile into a static library instead of a dynamic plugin. For linking
    static application you should have to use a 2nd rule where you have to
    specify which plugins you want to have linked into the application.
[W] Create templates for some IDEs. Generating a template for kdevelop3.x is
    very easy in theory but not possible at the moment, because kdevelop is only
    able to handle make as build tool. I already filled a featurerequest
    in the kdevelop bugtracker.
[W] It would be nice to have the configure files regenerated and execute if the
    configure.ac file has changed. Unfortunately it is not possible to force jam
    to reread it's config files, so this isn't 100% possible...
[H] The jobber scripts on sourceforge should use the Jamrules.
[H] The msvc generation rules aren't tested on msvc yet.
[M] Try if there's a way to create some suitable msvc templates for external
    proejcts, so that we autogenrate msvc-makefiles there too.
[L] Rework the provided m4 scripts to provide functionality like CS_CHECK_HOST
    and INITJAMFILE. Would be also nice to extract more of the detection scripts
    in CS (perl, python, nasm, problematic cflags?)
[M] Finish the tool for extracting the documentation from the rules files.
[M] Write some documentation and a Tutorial? (Maybe we could just link to the
    text in the RoboRun project...). Another interesting topic would be
    integrating Crystal Space with other build systems like automake or ant.
