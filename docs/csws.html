<H1>Overview</H1>
<H2>The Goal</H2>
<P>
  The main goal of Crystal Space Windowing System (<I>CSWS</I>) is to provide
  a clean, effective and cross-platform base for creating CrystalSpace-related
  utilites. Currently there is only one such utility under development:
  CrystalSpace maze editor.
</P>
<H2>Overall concepts</H2>
<P>
  There is nothing new in CSWS regarding the window system. All base conceptions
  for building such an system were invented far ago, at least when first X-windows
  system was built (at MIT(?)) or even earlier.
</P>
<P>
  The system is event-based, events are generated by hardware (mouse, keyboard)
  or software (components can send messages to each other). Event-system is
  system-dependent as well as graphics subsystem. They were developed first
  as part of CrystalSpace itself, then some modifications were made to better
  fit CSWS requirements. CSWS itself is completely system-independent, i.e.
  you can easily develop programs that will compile and work with no problems
  under any system supported by CrystalSpace.
</P>
<P>
  Since Crystal Space always uses buffered visuals, the screen repainting is
  always done on the invisible page. This means flickering on redraw is
  almost impossible in CSWS, while it is common on usual GUIs with bad-written
  programs. If visual has more than one backbuffer (like OS/2 port), the image
  is automatically re-syncronized on all back-buffers.
</P>
<P>
  Other CrystalSpace-specific feature is the division of event processing
  into "frames". Since CrystalSpace is a animation engine it operates in
  terms of frames, i.e. when the frame begins, all pending events in queue
  are processed, then all invalid components are redrawn, and at last the
  image is blitted onto the screen.
</P>
<HR>
<H1>Basic concepts</H1>
<HR>
<H2>Coordinate system</H2>
<P>
  Coordinate system is based on most-used (wrong :-) system when top-left
  corner is (0,0) and bottom-right corner is (width, height). It would be
  better to use the 'right' coordinate system used, for examplem, in OS/2
  and OpenGL but most programmers are already common with the 'wrong'
  system.
</P>
<P>
  Most CSWS functions works with rectangles (csRect class). The csRect
  class has four data fields: xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax which are self-explanatory.
  Here is a example of rectangle (xmin = 0, ymin = 0, xmax = 3, ymax = 2):
  <PRE>
       0  1  2  3  4 ...
       |  |  |  |  |  |
   0 --@@@@@@@@@@--+--+--
       @//|//|//@  |  |
   1 --@--+--+--@--+--+--
       @//|//|//@  |  |
   2 --@@@@@@@@@@--+--+--
       |  |  |  |  |  |
   3 --+--+--+--+--+--+--
       |  |  |  |  |  |
  ...--+--+--+--+--+--+--
  </PRE>
  Vertical line 'X=3' and horizontal line 'Y=2' does NOT belong to the
  rectangle. The hashed pixels belong to the rectangle. So, if you have
  two windows: (0, 0) - (3, 2) and (3, 0) - (6, 2) they do NOT overlap.
</P>
<HR>
<H2>Palette</H2>
<P>
  CSWS has been designed to operate transparently independent of screen
  geometry or number of colors. To allow normal operation in different
  pixel format conditions colors are kept in a dynamically-built table which
  is referenced through indexes in that table. To allow different palettes
  for windowing system each component does not use colors directly when drawing,
  instead each component has a pointer to a table which contains color values.
  So, for example, a component can have a palette which's first element is used
  as background color, second is used to display text in window and so on.
  By changing only the palette table we can change at once how all these
  components are looking.
</P>
<P>
  There is a number of pre-defined colors called cs_Color_XXX, for example
  cs_Color_Black, cs_Color_White etc. Components does not draw with
  cs_Color_XXX constants, they just indicate the index into their palette.
  All standard component palettes are contained in cswspal.cpp and cswspal.h
  files.
</P>
<HR>
<H1>Components</H1>
<P>
  The base class for windowing system is csComponent. csComponent is a very
  complex class with lots of built-in functionality. This allows for easier
  creation of new components for specific needs. Most csComponent methods
  are virtual, allowing to override them as needed. There are some basic
  methods, which are described below. Other methods are described as
  needed during this document.
</P>
<H3>csComponent::Draw ()</H3>
<P>
  Each component should know how to paint itself. When windowing system thinks
  a part of a component image or entire component image is invalid (for example,
  when a window is moved from the top of other components), it adds that
  rectangle to the 'dirty' rectangle of the component. The dirty rectangle
  is initially empty, then all invalid rectangles are added to it. At the end
  of each frame windowing system sends a broadcast event with cscmdRedraw
  command code. When component catches this event, it calls Redraw method
  which in turn calls csComponent::Draw. After csComponent::Draw returns
  control, the dirty rectangle is emptied again.
</P>
<P>
  All draw operations are clipped first against dirty rectangle and then
  against all component childs and neightbours. So drawing inside a component
  does not change even a pixel in other components, even if component is
  partialy covered by other components.
</P>
<P>
  There is a number of drawing operations that you can use. Other operations
  can be synthesized from existing. All coordinates used for drawing are
  component-origin related, so (0,0) corresponds to component top-left corner.
  <UL>
    <LI><TT>Line (x1, y1, x2, y2, colorindex)</TT>
        <P>Draw a line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2). Example: Line (0, 0, 3, 3)
        produces the following output:
        <PRE>
             0  1  2  3  4 ...

        </PRE>
    <LI><TT>Box (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax, colorindex)</TT>
        <P>Draw a filled box that is closed between lines (X &gt;= xmin),
        (X &lt; xmax), (Y &gt;= ymin) and (Y &lt; ymax). Example:
        Box (0, 0, 3, 2) will produce the following output:
        <PRE>
             0  1  2  3  4 ...

        </PRE>
    <LI><TT>Text (x, y, foregroundindex, backgroundindex, textstring)</TT>
        <P>Display a text string starting from (x, y) with color "foregroundindex"
        and background "backgroundindex". If backgroundindex == -1, the text
        is drawn transparently. To determint text width and height you can use
        the <TT>TextWidth (textstring)</TT> and <TT>TextHeight ()</TT>
        functions. There is a number of built-in CSWS fonts, they can be
        used by calling SetFont (cs_Font_XXXX). Note that both TextWidth()
        and TextHeight() depends on current font.
    <LI><TT>Sprite2D (sprite2d, x, y, w, h)</TT>
        (you can ommit w,h to use normal sprite size).
        <P>Draw a 2D sprite or bitmap. "sprite2d" is a object of csPixmap
        class. Sprite can have transparent colors, this way you can define
        "holes" in textures.
    <LI><TT>Rect3D (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax, darkindex, lightindex)</TT>
        <P>Draw a 3D-looking rectangle. This method just draws four lines
        to form a non-filled rectangle. Example: Rect3D (0, 0, 4, 4);
        <PRE>

        <P>Draw a rectangle with oblique corners of given size.
        Example: ObliqueRect3D (0, 0, 10, 7, 3).

        </PRE>
    <LI><TT>SetClipRect (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)</TT>
        <P>Define a local clipping rectangle for subsequent drawing
        operations. For example, when drawing a button you may want to
        set clipping rectangle after drawing button borders so that
        button text accidentally won't draw over its borders even if
        it does not fit. To disable clipping you can define a empty
        rectangle (SetClipRect (0, 0, 0, 0));
  </UL>
</P>
<H3>csComponent::HandleEvent (csEvent &Event)</H3>
<P>
  This is the main component's entry point for handling windowing system
  events. Each time user presses a key, moves mouse etc windowing system
  generates a event and sends it to appropiate component. The normal
  event flow is top-down, i.e. the root window receives events first,
  then passes them if appropiate to its childs which passes it to their
  respective childs and so on. However, there are some basical constraints
  on event flow that you should know about:
  <UL>
    <LI>HandleEvent should return a boolean value that states whenever this
        object used the event or not. If the event has been used, no other
        component will receive it anymore, otherwise windowing system looks
        for other appropiate candidates for this event. The only exception
        from this rule are broadcast events that are sent to all childs
        independently of the fact that component "eaten" event or not.
    <LI>Mouse events are received only by the topmost component mouse pointer
        is over and its parents. If other behaviour is desired, a component should
        capture the mouse by calling <TT>app-&gt;CaptureMouse (this)</TT> - in this case mouse
        events are sent by application object directly to the object that captured
        the mouse, bypassing normal event flow. To revert to normal mode of operation
        component should call <TT>app-&gt;CaptureMouse (NULL)</TT>.
    <LI>Keyboard events are sent only to components from <A HREF=#focuschain>"focus chain"</A>.
        If a different behaviour is desired, component should capture keyboard
        events by calling <TT>app-&gt;CaptureKeyboard (this)</TT>. To disable
        capturing keyboard events component should call <TT>app-&gt;CaptureKeyboard (NULL)</TT>
    <LI>Command events are not sent to child windows. A reply to command event is normally
        expected from the component it has been sent to, not from any of its childs.
        Moreover, re-sending command events to childs can be dangerous since the event
        can be sent by one of its childs, and the application can get caught in an
        endless loop. Re-sending command events to parents is a normal practice, for
        example all menus re-send command events to their parents since commands are
        usually sent to menus by their childs (menu items or even sub-menus).
    <LI>Broadcast events are the only type of events that are guaranteed to reach
        every object in a subtree of components.
  </UL>
</P>
<P>
  There is another method called <TT>csComponent::PreHandleEvent (csEvent &Event)</TT>
  which is much like HandleEvent except that it is called for each event pulled
  from event queue before HandleEvent, and without rules above, i.e. any component
  can preprocess any hardware-generated event before it is sent along normal event
  handling chain. This can be used for popup menus, hot keys and so on. If
  PreHandleEvent returns true, the event is considered "eaten" and is discarded.
  Be careful with this feature to avoid interfering with normal component
  functions.
</P>
<P>
  And last method related to event processing is <TT>csComponent::PostHandleEvent (csEvent &Event)</TT>.
  It is called when no component handled the event and it is called for all components
  in parent->children order. It can be used to process events that nobody wants,
  for example it is used to process hotkeys on buttons (if active component is
  for example, a input line, and user presses 'A' key it should be entered into
  input text, while if active component is a non text-hungry component (for example,
  a listbox) the 'A' key can be used by some button to activate itself).
</P>
<H3>Data csComponent fields</H3>
<P>
  csComponent class has a number of data fields. The most important is
  <PRE>
  csRect bound;
  </PRE>
  which defines the physical bounds of the component. All drawing operations happens
  inside and are clipped to this bound. Component does not have control over any other
  pixel outside this bound. The bounds are defined relative to parent's origin. For
  example, if we have a component with bounds (xmin = 20, ymin = 10, xmax = 100, ymax = 50)
  and it has a child (10, 10, 30, 40) then its real (physical) pixel coordinates are
  (20+10, 10+10, 20+30, 10+40). A child is always clipped to the bounds of all its
  parents (however, there is a exception from this rule).
</P>
  <PRE>
  int state;
  </PRE>
<P>
  contains the state flags of the component. There are two types of state flags
  (although CSWS does not make a difference between them) - dynamic flags and
  option flags. Option flags usually define some static aspect of component -
  for example, whenever component is selectable (i.e. if it can become the
  focused element), or it is partially transparent
  (<A HREF=#transpcomp>irregularily-shaped components</A>) etc.
  Dynamic flags often changes during component's life, for example component
  visibility flag, "component focused" flag and so on. The component state
  flags starts with the CSS_ prefix.
</P>
<P>
  You should never change manually state flags. Instead, there are two
  methods for this: <TT>SetState (mask, state)</TT> and <TT>GetState (mask)</TT>.
  For example, if component is not selectable and you want to make it selectable,
  call component.SetState (CSS_SELECTABLE, true). The SetState method is
  virtual and is often overriden to execute some specific functions when
  component state changes. For example, default SetState handler shows or
  hides the component if CSS_VISIBLE flag state changes.
</P>
<P>
  <PRE>
  csRect dirty;
  </PRE>
  contains the "dirty" rectangle. If it is non-empty, the dirty area of component
  is redrawn just before the end-of-frame.
</P>
<P>
  <PRE>
  int DragStyle;
  </PRE>
  Contains a combination of bits (CS_DRAG_XXX) that defines which sides of component
  can be dragged with mouse when you call first the csComponent::Drag method.
  By default it is equal to CS_DRAG_ALL. Note that if component won't call csComponent::Drag
  you won't be able to resize the component even if DragStyle will be equal to CS_DRAG_ALL.
</P>
<P>
  <PRE>
  csApp *app;
  </PRE>
  This is the "main" application object, the root of entire window tree. It is a
  descendant of csApp class which is a superclass of csComponent. csApp has
  some application-global methods such as CaptureMouse, CaptureKeyboard,
  it contains the global mouse pointer object and many other.
</P>
<P>
  <PRE>
  csComponent *parent;
  </PRE>
  Contains the parent component. Components are chained into a tree, each
  component knows its neightbours (through "next" and "prev" fields),
  each parent knows its focused child, and can traverse its list
  of childs by starting from focused, then going to focused-&gt;next and
  so on.
</P>
<P>
  <PRE>
  csComponent *prev, *next;
  </PRE>
  Contains the next and previous neightbours in parent's child list.
  They are never NULL, chains are always closed. If a component is
  the only child of another, its next and prev fields points to himself.
</P>
<P>
  <PRE>
  <A NAME="focuschain">csComponent *focused;</A>
  </PRE>
  This is the focused child component. For example, keyboard events are sent
  only to components in "focused" chain, i.e. to app, app-&gt;focused,
  app-&gt;focused-&gt;focused and so on. If component does not have any
  child components, focused is NULL. This is the only possible case when
  "focused" can be NULL.
</P>
<P>
  <PRE>
  csComponent *top;
  </PRE>
  This is the top component in Z-order. Mouse events are processed in Z-order
  unlike keyboard events. The focused event is not neccessarily the top component,
  although usually this is true. If component has "CSS_TOPSELECT" flag set,
  when user activates (focuses) a component, it is made the topmost, however
  if it has this flag reset, its Z-order does not change.
</P>
<P>
  <PRE>
  int id;
  </PRE>
  This is component's identifier. This is a user-definable value, but it is
  expected to be unique within all childs of a parent component. You can
  search for child components with given ID by calling <TT>parent->GetChild(int find_id)</TT>.
</P>
<HR>
<H1>Events</H1>
<P>
  There are several event types (other event types can be defined as needed,
  but existing set covers all current CSWS needs). There is the base event
  class called csEvent. It has several public data fields, the mostly used
  is Type which contains the event type. There are following currently defined
  event types:
  <UL>
    <LI><B>csevNothing</B> - "empty" event, mostly used internally by CSWS.
    <LI><B>csevKeyDown</B> - key has been pressed event.
    <LI><B>csevKeyUp</B> - key has been released event. On KeyUp and KeyDown events
        the following data fields in event object are also valid:
        <UL>
          <LI>Key.Code - contains code of key that has been pressed or released.
              It can be a literal value ('A', 'z', ' ') or one of predefined
              CSKEY_XXX values (CSKEY_UP, CSKEY_ESC, CSKEY_SPACE, CSKEY_ENTER etc).
          <LI>Key.ShiftKeys - contains the state of shift keys at time when this
              event has been generated. Note that it not neccessarily is the
              same as current key state. To decode its value you should use
              the pre-defined CSMASK_XXX constants (for example,
              <PRE>
              if (Event.Key.ShiftKeys == CSMASK_ALT)
              {
                ... ALT + Event.Key.Code pressed ...
              }
              </PRE>
              or,
              <PRE>
              if (Event.Key.ShiftKeys & CSMASK_ALT)
              {
                ... (<I>at least</I> ALT) + Event.Key.Code pressed ...
              }
              </PRE>
              Also there is a bit in ShiftKeys called CSMASK_FIRST that is set
              only when key is pressed for first time. With this you can separate
              actual key presses from autorepeated keyboard events.
        </UL>
    <LI><B>csevMouseMove</B> - "mouse has been moved" event.
    <LI><B>csevMouseDown</B> - "a mouse button has been pressed" event.
    <LI><B>csevMouseUp</B> - "a mouse button has been released" event. On all mouse
        events the following data fields in event object are also valid:
        <UL>
          <LI>Mouse.x, Mouse.y - the screen position where mouse event happened.
              Mouse position is always converted to component coordinate system,
              i.t. Mouse.x == 0 && Mouse.y == 0 means that mouse is at component
              top-left system.
          <LI>Button - mouse button number, counting from 1. Not valid for
              "mouse moved" event.
          <LI>Key.ShiftKeys - contains the state of shift keys at time when this
              event has been generated. See above for comments on shift keys.
        </UL>
    <LI><B>csevCommand</B> - a command event. Command events are generated by
        windowing system components, not by hardware. For example, when a
        button is pressed, it sends a command event with some command code
        to its parent component. There is only one data field for this type
        of events called Info of type "void *". It can point to any
        event-related information.
    <LI><B>csevBroadcast</B> - broadcast events are much like command events, except
        that no component can intercept ("eat") it, and they are feed to all
        child, grandchild etc components in a component tree (starting from
        the component that received first this event).
  </UL>
</P>
<P>
  To check if the event is generated by keyboard, you can use the predefined
  IS_KEYBOARD_EVENT(Event) macro. To check for mouse events, you can use the
  IS_MOUSE_EVENT(Event) macro.
</P>
<HR>
<H1>Clipping</H1>
<P>
  Clipping is the process of removing parts of output covered by other
  components. CSWS has full clipping implemented for all existing
  graphics primitives. There is no drawing operation that can influence
  other component's image (except <A HREF=#transpcomp>transparent windows</A>).
  Clipping is performed in the following way: First primitive is clipped
  against "dirty" rectangle (to cut off excessive output), then it is clipped
  against all its neightbours, then against "clip parent" window and all its
  neightbours and so on.
</P>
<H3>Clip parents</H3>
<P>
  All components have a "parent" component and a "clipparent" component. What
  they are used for? Usually "clipparent" is equal to "parent" so there is
  no difference between them. But in some rare cases there is a need to
  perform clipping in a different way. For example, popup menus that belong
  to a window usually should not be clipped against that window, but rather
  to the parent of parent window or even clipped only to desktop. In this
  case you should assign a different clip parent to that component. This
  can be performed by using <TT>InsertClipChild()</TT> method. For example,
  to make a menu clip to application's bounds, you should call
  <PRE>
  app-&gt;InsertClipChild (menu);
  </PRE>
  You should not assign directly  to "clipparent" variable since
  InsertClipChild does many extra work, for example it inserts the so-called
  "clip child" into component's clip child list, removes component from
  former clipparent's "clip child" list and so on.

<A NAME="transpcomp"><H3>Partialy transparent components</H3></A>
<P>
  You can set a state flag called CSS_TRANSPARENT to mark semi-transparent components.
  Transparent components works differently in the following ways:
  <UL>
    <LI>When a part of such a component is invalidated, the same area of parent
        component is invalidated as well.
    <LI>Mouse events for such components are considered "eaten" only if component's
        HandleEvent method returned TRUE. Otherwise, the event is sent to the component
        placed one level below the transparent area.
    <LI>Parent's window output is not clipped against transparent childs. Instead of
        this, child's area covered by output is invalidated.
  </UL>

<H1>Quick Tutorial<H1>
In the following I will try to explain how to build simple applications using
Crystal Space Windowing System. I hope you will understand enough to start
writing your own applications; I also hope you will get a deeper knowledge of
CSWS during your development (or lab) sessions.
<HR>
<H2>A simple application</H2>
The simplest possible application should do the following:
<UL>
  <LI>Create an application object (csApp)
  <LI>Run the application (run the main event processing loop)
  <LI>Finish the application (delete the object)
</UL>
Let's try:
<CODE>
#include "csws/csws.h"

int main (int argc, char* argv[])
{
  csApp app ("CSWS test application", argc, argv);

  if (app.InitialSetup ())
    app.Loop ();
}
</CODE>
Pretty simple, eh? So the result is as well :-) We got a gray background, a
mouse and nothing more. What the program does:
<P>
First, it creates a csApp object called "app". To initialize the application
you pass three parameters: the window title (for system that support a window
title) and argument vector passed to main() so that Crystal Space low-level
layer can eat such arguments as "-mode", "-depth" and so on.
<P>
The next step is to call InitialSetup() method. The csApp's InitialSetup()
method does nothing except returning true, but you probably will want to
override it to initialize your application there. Create a popup menu, insert
it into the desktop, add some windows, read configuration files etc.
<P>
And finally we run the main application loop. The event consuming loop does
the following: while there are events in input queue: read an event, pass it
to HandleEvent method. If there weren't any events in the loop, call Idle()
method to give some time slices to other running applications (if
csSystemDriver::Sleep() method is implemented properly). If some window needs
redrawing, it is redrawn. After this the screen is updated and everything starts
again from the beginning.
<P>
If you observe, our above program does not delete the csApp object. That's
because it is a automatic variable and not a pointer, so its automatically
deleted when program finishes. If you would use a pointer, you should
explicitely delete the app pointer with delete() command.
