<i><b><a name="where">
Where can I download Crystal Space?
</a></b></i><br>
<b>A1. </b>
The latest beta release (0.15) can be downloaded from:<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://crystal.linuxgames.com">My Home Page</a>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.linuxgames.com/crystal">FTP Space for my home page</a>
</ul>
There are a number of mirrors on that page.
<br>
<b>A2. </b>
The even more later CVS version can also be used. There are
instructions for CVS on <a href="http://crystal.linuxgames.com">my page</a>
(including the location of the CVS server).
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------><p><hr><p>
<i><b><a name="whatcom">
What do you need to compile Crystal Space?
</a></b></i><br>
<b>A1. </b>
A compiler and a computer! :-)
<br>
<b>A2. </b>
Seriously though. Although you really need a compiler and a computer you obviously
need more than that: you need the Crystal Space source archive :-)
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------><p><hr><p>
<i><b><a name="whatrun">
What do you need to run Crystal Space?
</a></b></i><br>
<b>A. </b>
You need the following:
<ul>
<li>The WalkTest executable. This is a demo program that is included in the main
    source archive. This is what most people see as 'Crystal Space' although it
    is actually only a program using Crystal Space. Note that there exist two types
    of executables: staticly linked and dynamically linked. If you have a staticly
    linked executable (for example, the DOS executable will always be static) then
    you don't need any of the following drivers. Otherwise you will need:
<li>A 3D Rasterizer library. You can choose either the software renderer or else one
    of the hardware accelerated renderers. You also have to choose the correct
    library for your system. On OS/2 and Windows this will be a DLL file. On Unix
    (Linux) this will be SO file.
<li>A 2D Graphics driver. Some of the 3D Rasterizer libraries already contain the
    corresponding 2D Graphics driver but the software renderer does not. In that
    case you need to download the correct 2D Graphics driver for your system.
<li>The Network NULL driver. This driver provides dummy networking support for your
    system. Download this if you're not interested in networking (just yet).
<li>The Network Sockets driver. This driver provides a socket networking implementation.
    Use this if your system supports this and you want to experiment with networking.
<li>For all features in Crystal Space to work correctly you should also download
    'standard.zip'. You should NOT extract this file, Crystal Space can read from
    the ZIP file directly. It contains additional data that is used by the engine.
    If it is not present then some features (like sound and the missile) may not
    work correctly.
<li>Finally you need at least one level file. This is also a ZIP archive (like large.zip,
    maze.zip, or room.zip) and should NOT be extracted. Note that 'mazed.zip' is NOT
    a level file and is ment for MazeD. 'standard.zip' can also not be used as a
    level file.
</ul>
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------><p><hr><p>
<i><b><a name="install">
I downloaded Crystal Space and it won't run!
</a></b></i><br>
<b>A1. </b>
Are you sure that you have downloaded everything as explained in the two
previous questions? If so then go to the following answer.
<br>
<b>A2. </b>
Crystal Space requires an 8, 15, 16, or 32-bit display and will not
work on other displays currently.
<br>
<b>A3. </b>
Several people coudn't run Crystal Space because they downloaded an
executable and it didn't seem to be a valid executable. It turned out that
the problem was that their browser removed the 'gz' extension from the
file while downloading without decompressing it. The executables that you
can downloaded are compressed with 'gzip' and you first need to decompress
them before you can run them.
<br>
<b>A4. </b>
If you are using a dynamicly linked executable (like the ones on Unix,
Windows, BeOS, Macintosh, and OS/2) then you should not forget to register
the SCF drivers included with CS (the 3D Rasterizer, the 2D Graphics Driver
and the networking drivers).  This is done with the 'scfregsvr' utility.
Just type scfregsvr *.so.  Instructions on other systems will be similar.
<br>
<b>A5. </b>
Are you sure it is trying to load the correct level? If you are running with a
commandline (DOS-box or a Unix shell) you can try to give the level you want to
run on the commandline like this: cryst ../data/maze.zip. Otherwise you can also
edit 'cryst.cfg' and change the line 'WORLDFILE=...' to the correct level.
<br>
<b>A6. </b>
If all else fails mail me :-)

<i><b><a name="docs">
What about documentation?
</a></b></i><br>
<b>A. </b>
There is a lot of documentation available. Not all of it is completely up-to-date
but we try to do our best in keeping them as up-to-date as possible. Here are quick
pointers to all documentation:
<ul>
<li>The documentation included with CS: at the same place as where you can download
    the CS sources you should also be able to download the file 'docs???.tgz' or
    'docs???.zip'. This archive contains a lot of documents (about the console, the
    configuration file, sound, MazeD, internal workings of CS, the history of CS, the
    format of world files, and so on...)
<li>Automatically generated documentation: there is also the archive 'csdoc???.tgz'
    which contains automatically generated HTML documentation. This documentation
    is generated from the source and is ideal for getting an idea of the class
    structure used in Crystal Space.
<li>Various other documents: on the (<A HREF="http://crystal.linuxgames.com">Home Page</A>)
    there are some other documents related to 3D and Crystal Space including the very
    important CS API document (which is unfinished). This document intends to be the main
    document that is going to be used by game developers.
</ul>

<i><b><a name="lowmemory">
I don't have lots of memory. Can I still run Crystal Space?
</a></b></i><br>
<b>A1. </b>
Well, that depends. There are several things that you can do to
decrease memory usage. First of all, version 0.06 of Crystal Space
is already a lot more efficient than previous versions so things
may already work.
<br>
<b>A2. </b>
If this is still not enough you can decrease the size of the texture
cache with the -cache <size> commandline option or the CACHE config
file option (in 'cryst.cfg'). By default this is set to 5000000 which
means 5 megabytes of memory. You can safely decrease this to
1200000 (but don't go any lower or you may get crashes!) thus saving
a whopping 3600000 bytes!
<br>
<b>A3. </b>
Using a low resolution also decreases the memory usage. Crystal Space
uses a Z-buffer containing long (4-byte) values with the same size
as the display. So a display of 640x480 uses a Z-buffer of 1228800
bytes!
<br>
<b>A4. </b>
If you are still low on memory there is only one thing you can do:
decrease the complexity of the world. For every polygon in
the world there is a lot of memory used (the lightmaps for
example). If you just want to try the engine you can run Crystal
Space with some of the simpler worlds (like 'perf.zip', 'rgb.zip',
or 'simple.zip'). 'perf.zip' is a good choice because it is not
too complex and it contains most of the features Crystal Space has
(since it is designed for performance testing).
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------><p><hr><p>
<i><b><a name="slow">
Crystal Space is really slow on my computer. Can't something be
done about this?
</a></b></i><br>
<b>A1. </b>
Crystal Space is a 6DOF engine. It needs to do semi-perspective
correct texture mapping to get a nice display and this is slow. Compare
Crystal Space to Quake and you will see that Crystal Space is not
terribly slow (it is slower but only by a few frames per second on
my Pentium 90). You can expect that Crystal Space will probably
need the same kind of computer as Quake: at least a Pentium
or a very fast 486 with a floating point coprocessor.
On my old computer (a Pentium 90 with 16M memory) and a screen size
of 640x480 I got about 6-9 FPS with no assembler and 8-12 FPS
with assembler.
<br>
<b>A2. </b>
Of course I'm always glad to accept any code that would speed up
Crystal Space. Please try.
<br>
<b>A3. </b>
Many things are being done currently to try to speed up Crystal
Space. Hardware acceleration is one important area but there are
others.
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------><p><hr><p>
<i><b><a name="textures">
I want to create textures for Crystal Space. What palette should
I use? How big should I create the textures? What format can I use?
</a></b></i><br>
<b>A1. </b>
The palette does not really matter because Crystal Space tries
to calculate the most optimal palette given a set of input textures.
But there are some things to keep in mind. Try to get the number
of different colors as low as possible without sacrificing for
quality and if you design a set of textures that are meant to be
used together it is always best to let them use a similar palette.
This will make it easier for Crystal Space to calculate a good
palette. If you run Crystal Space in truecolor mode (15/16/32-bit
mode) and with private colormaps then there is actually no need
anymore for using similar palettes.
<br>
<b>A2. </b>
The width and height of a texture must be a power of 2 (8, 16, 32,
64, ...). That's about the only restriction. Textures need not
be square (but it is probably easier to keep them square). You
can have textures with sizes like 16x256.
<br>
<b>A3. </b>
Crystal Space currently uses GIF by default but it can also read
TGA, PNG, BMP, and JPG (if enabled in the makefile).
<br>
<b>A4. </b>
Unless a texture is not meant for tiling you should make sure that
it can be tiled. This means that if you put a number of textures
next to each other of above each other the boundaries of the
'tiles' should seemlessly integrate with each other.
Of course, it is perfectly possible to create textures that are
specifically drawn for untiled usage. An example would be a
texture representing a computer keyboard. This texture will
probably not be tiled (it would be a little strange).
<br>
<b>A5. </b>
I have some imaging tools (like XV and ImageMagick) so I can do
a lot with any textures I get. If you can't output to GIF, no
problem, I can read almost any image format. If the size is not
a power of two I will scale them. If the image uses too many
colors I can reduce the number of colors...
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------><p><hr><p>
<i><b><a name="contribute">
I'd like to contribute to Crystal Space. What can I do?
</a></b></i><br>
<b>A. </b>
Have a look at the <a href="todo.html">Todo</a> file. I try to keep a fairly comprehensive
list of missing features and bugs there.
You should contact me so that I can coordinate the
efforts and avoid duplicate work.
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------><p><hr><p>
<i><b><a name="how">
How does Crystal Space work?
</a></b></i><br>
<b>A1. </b>
This is a short question with a long answer. Two documents
to get you started are 'document.txt' and 'cam_matr.txt' (both
included with Crystal Space). 'document.txt' contains a description
of how Crystal Space uses the portal system and how lighting works.
'cam_matr.txt' is a document explaining how the camera system is
used in Crystal Space.
'document.txt' assumes that you have some knowledge about matrices,
and 3D mathematics in general. 'cam_matr.txt' gives more information
about matrices and transformations so you can read that file first.
'walkthru.txt' is also a good source of internal information.
<br>
<b>A2. </b>
Also see the <a href="#docs">documentation question</a> for more information
about available documents.
<br>
<b>A3. </b>
If you still need more information (after all, not everything is
explained in those two documents) just mail me and I will answer
you as soon as I can.
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------><p><hr><p>
<i><b><a name="projects">
I want to write a game/MUD/RPG/... with Crystal Space? Can
I do this? Will you help me? ...
</a></b></i><br>
<b>A1. </b>
The ultimate purpose of Crystal Space is that it will become a useable
and powerful engine for writing games and other similar programs.
The current version of Crystal Space (0.14) is slowly starting to get ready for this.
You can contribute to Crystal Space to make CS even better!
I'm willing to help anyone trying to use Crystal Space is another
project. However, because of time constraints I will only do development
and management of the general Crystal Space engine. Specific features
and game development will have to be done by someone else (maybe this
changes in future if I will ever acquire more of that precious resource:
TIME, but I doubt it). Of course, any enhancements to Crystal Space
will undoubtedly benefit all developers using Crystal Space so this
should not really be a problem.
<br>
<b>A2. </b>
Since Crystal Space is now using the LGPL licensing policy you can
make commercial or shareware products using it. See the file COPYING
which you can find in the source archive for more details about what
you can and cannot do.
