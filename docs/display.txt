Render Quality
--------------

With MIXLIGHTS and TXTMODE you can control the final quality of the
renderer (including the choice of colors) and also the startup speed
of Crystal Space. The effects of these flags are also dependent on the
pixel width of your display (current 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit).

The following table describes all the (useful) possibilities.
'Display' is the width of the display (8, 16, or 32).
'MIX' is the setting for MIXLIGHTS.
'TXTMODE' is the setting for TXTMODE.
'TSpeed' is the speed of the texture cache. From very good to very bad,
    here are the ratings: 'fast', 'good', 'fair', 'slow', and 'bad'.
