The Big 1.0 TODO List:

Every bug is classified with a few modifiers to indicate
the bad effect they have on CS. The following modifiers
can be given:
	- V: visual effect. This means that solving this bug
	  or implementing this feature would improve how the engine looks.
	- S: stability. This bug causes loss of stability.
	  Solving this bug will cause CS to be more stable.
	- F: feature. This means some feature isn't implemented properly
	  or implementation is missing completely.
	- O: organization and other. An organizational change or something
	  else.
	- **: bug or feature has been fixed or implemented.

Bugs to fix:
	[S]  Line drawing in software renderer is not stable (overwriting
	     memory). This shows with BugPlug and also with AWS in some
	     cases.
	[O]  Add the ability to get different kinds of polygon meshes from
	     objects: lower-lod version for culling, version for collision
	     detection, version for lighting (casting shadows), ...
	[O]  Mark polygons as being visible, used for shadow casting,
	     used for culling, used for collision detection, ... (more
	     general system).
	[O]  Remove old octree based culler when Dynavis is ok and levtool
	     can convert to Dynavis levels.
	[O]  Implement splatting in Dynavis.
	[O]  Implement 3-bit outline renderer in Dynavis.
	[O]  Implement better kd-tree balancing in Dynavis.
	[V]  Investigate if LOD for sprites is still working.
	[S]  Investigate if there are any more memory leaks after
	     unloading a level and if so fix them.
	     This can most easily be done by using the debug graph in
	     CS. To enable this just edit include/csutil/debug.h and
	     remove the comment ('//') right before the define of
	     CS_USE_GRAPHDEBUG. Then recompile.
	[V]  Investigate various visible artifacts in the mazedex
	     level. It appears that most of these have to do with the
	     halos and only appear with OpenGL. One artifact appears
	     to be Z-fighting (with OpenGL alone) and this occurs
	     if you look into the reflecting table.
	[V]  Static lighting no longer goes through space-warping
	     portals.
	[V]  One of the halos in flarge seems to disappear in some cases
	     with OpenGL.
	[V]  Walktest + newsky: it appears that there are some visibility
	     culling problems in some rare cases.
	     Solution: try to find a spot that doesn't work right and
	     remember with 'C'. Later on you can go back to that position
	     with 'c' (after including debug info).
	     Here's a cam file for it:

	[V]  Fix radiosity so that it works again. Radiosity is currently
	     disabled because several things had been rewritten and the
	     radiosity code was left behind.
	     To fix this we need to have a way to iterate over all polygons.
	     This is not hard. Harder will be the fact that the lighting
	     system has changed. It now works with the shadow bitmaps.
	     [Bug 429283]
	[F]  Gouraud shaded polygons are not supported well: you can only
	     define triangles that are gouraud shaded and not polygons in
	     general.
	     After closing inspection it seems that this *almost* works
	     perfectly now. However there are cases when texture mapping
	     is wrong.
	     [Bug 202768]
	[V]  Investigate if skeletal sprites work nicely with the
	     visibility culling system.
	     Major problem is that calculating a bounding box for a skeletal
	     sprite is not easy. We have to find an efficient way to do this,
	     especially when the transforms change.
	     [Bug 204194]
	[V]  Lighting for skeletal sprites is not good. The problem is that
	     normals are precalculated for the 'base mesh'. When the mesh
	     later animates (using the transforms) the normals will not
	     change. A solution is perhaps to transform the normals with
	     the hierarchical transform. But this will not work correctly
	     for vertices that are connected to triangles that have vertices
	     from other limbs.
	     [Bug 493454]
	[V]  Mesh objects outside the global bounding box of an
	     infinite sector will not be visible.
	     There is a work-around for this bug which is why this bug is
	     not that bad. You can easily add small dummy geometry very far
	     away to make the bounding box work. Problem is that this
	     dummy geometry has to be part of the static mesh!
	     [Bug 216698]
	[V]  Light with explosion particle system is not correctly
	     positioned.
	     The question is if this light is a desired feature.
	     [Bug 231392]
	[V]  The software renderer implementation of DrawTriangleMesh
	     is still missing a few clipping features. In general it would
	     be nice to investigate the use of the OpenGL clipping routines
	     for software too.
	     [Bug 430207]
	[V]  Investigate clipping bug in OpenGL.
	     [Bug 430214]
	[V]  In OpenGL adjacent polygons do not match nicely. Especially if
	     you clear the background every frame you can easily notice
	     gaps between polygons.
	     [Bug 430601]
	[V]  Investigate bugs related to the walktest 'portal' command and
	     to portals in general.
	     (For example: [Bug 473597])
	     There also seem to be several clipping bugs still.
	[F]  When mounting a real directory on a VFS path you need to do:
	        Mount ("this/is/a/dir$/", "/lib/whatever");
	     i.e. the last '/' has to be preceeded with '$'. This needs
	     to be fixed.
	[**] With OpenGL the lightmaps are not mapped correctly.
	     This is very visible if you have two adjacent polygons which
	     have a different size and a shadow going over those two
	     polygons (in dmburg this situation occurs a few times).
	     In that case the shadows on both polygons will not match
	     exactly.
	     Fixing this bug for real probably requires a change of the
	     lightmap format (to make then one lumel bigger both horizontally
	     as vertically). While this is relatively easy to do for
	     static lightmaps the dynamic lightmaps might be more problematic.
	     Also this may require a big change in the software renderer...
	     Rather complicated bug. But an important one to fix.
	     [Bug 405964]
	[**] Fix the problem with adding -lutil for more recent
	     versions of python. This should be automatic and not manual.
	[**] Shoot a missile in hole in flarge. The walls of the hole
	     become lit ok then but revert to full bright after missile
	     particles have disappeared. Only with OpenGL.
	[**] Fade effect no longer works in OpenGL (visible in csdemo and
	     F5 key in walktest). May be related to the fact that a material
	     without texture is used and this has recently changed.
	[**] It seems that pseudo-dynamic lighting is not working
	     correctly. In flarge you can see that near the stairs
	     some polygons are not updated when the dynamic light
	     changes intensity/color.
	[**] Investigate if PlaceMesh() works correctly. I suspect it
	     doesn't. May be related to bug [Bug 471637].
	[**] Bug with models seen through portals [Bug 471638].
	[**] In isometric engine (isotest) + OpenGL some of the mesh
	     objects (like the particle systems) are clipped wrong to the
	     floor.
	     This is a very hard bug. We have been hunting this bug for
	     ages. Z-buffer accuracy problems have been suspected but this
	     is probably not right because the problem arises on cards
	     with 32-bit Z-buffer too.
	[**] Lighting is not cached for gouraud shaded polygons.
	     [Bug 202780]
	[**] Problem with keycolor + zbuffer:
	     When a texture with keycolor transparency is rendered the
	     software and hardware renderers currently behave differently.
	     With software the z-buffer is only updated at those positions
	     where the texture is actually drawn. This is very nice of
	     course since that means you can essentially draw the keycolor
	     texture using Z-buffer and objects drawn behind it will be correct.
	     However this doesn't work with hardware. With hardware the
	     Z-buffer is updated for the entire polygon regardsless of the
	     key-color value.
	     I'm not sure if it is actually possible to do otherwise with
	     hardware. If not then the engine will have to solve this by
	     sorting such polygons from back to front in relation to other
	     objects in the same sector.
	     [Bug 409067]
	[F]  Support space warping portals for GetNearbyObjects(), for
	     PlaceMesh() and for lighting.
	[F]  Support lights for GetNearbyObjects().

API and Small Feature Additions:
	[F]  Translate point on polygon to texture space/object space
	     coordinates (for selection). This is useful for Quark++.
	[F]  Ability to close portals in map loader.
	[F]  Support iPolygonMesh (for collision detection) in more
	     mesh objects (like ball, cube, ...).
	[V]  Support lighting of a thing mesh for lights in multiple
	     sectors (and going through portals). i.e.
	     iSector->ShineLights (iMeshWrapper).
	[F]  Change key code and virtual key in keyboard event to use
	     unicode.
	[**] Automatic generation of lightmap cache names using MD5
	     checksum of geometry. This is important for dynamic
	     loading/reloading of worlds.
	[**] Add iCamera::SetFarPlane().

Global Additions and Stuff:
	[F]  Direct3D8 Renderer.
	[O]  Split of CS module in CS and CSextra. Applications like
	     Blocks will then move to CSextra.
	[F]  [OPTIONAL?] Configuration setup tool so that it is
	     possible to edit config files with a GUI?
	[S]  There are still a few places where we need to use the
	     reporter for reporting error conditions.
	[**] Remove Squawk after implementing a multi-view demo
	     in WalkTest.
