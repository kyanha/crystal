Things that need to be done in new renderer:

	- Support hierarchical meshes. Currently only the top-level mesh
	  is considered.
	- Support static LOD. This is a special case of a hierarchical mesh
	  where only one of the children is drawn based on distance
	  related conditions.
	- Make csShader a csObject so it can be supported in regions.
	  Also add iRegion->PrepareShaders().
	- Meshes remaining to be ported:
		- spr2d (and the particle systems)
		- rain
		- haze
		- beziermesh
		- lightning
		- cloth
		- terrfunc (disabled from jam build!)
		- terrbig (disabled from jam build!)
		- bcterr
		- sprcal3d
		- stars
	- Software renderer (partially done).
	- Working loaders for all new features (partially done).
	- Fog (can/should be implemented through shaders).
	- Lightmaps:
		- Add LM support to renderer (DONE, partially).
		- Teach thing to use LM on NR (DONE, partially).
		- Will need some way to distinguish between 'static' and
		  'dynamic' lights and objects (move vs non-move).
	- Portals.
	- Debug lines and everything related to debugging support in g3d.
	- Correct usage of cullers.
	- Isometric engine.
	- Shadows (needs fixing).
	- Variable system (done, more or less).
	- Materials (done, more or less).
	- Pseudo VP with similar functionality as old texture layers.
	- Fix smoothed things. (Done)
	- Better error handling. Everything is too crashy.
