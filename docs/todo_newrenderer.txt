Things that need to be done in new renderer:

	- Support hierarchical meshes. Currently only the top-level mesh
	  is considered.
	- Support static LOD. This is a special case of a hierarchical mesh
	  where only one of the children is drawn based on distance
	  related conditions.
	- Make csShader a csObject so it can be supported in regions.
	  Also add iRegion->PrepareShaders().
	- Meshes remaining to be ported:
		- spr2d (and the particle systems)
		- rain
		- haze
		- beziermesh
		- lightning
		- cloth
		- terrfunc (disabled from jam build!)
		- terrbig (disabled from jam build!)
		- bcterr
		- sprcal3d
		- stars
