# The 'manual' and 'api' subdirectories are generated automatically by
# $(TOP)/bin/jobber.pl on a daily basis. That script processes and knows about
# generated files only, and will correctly 'cvs add' and 'cvs remove' items
# from those directories as required.  Consequently, we can not have Jamfiles
# in those directories (since jobber.pl would "cvs remove" them because they
# are not "generated").  Therefore, we perform tasks for those subdirectories
# here instead.
