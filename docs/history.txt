The history order has been reversed so that new features are at the top.

Short-term cleanups that need to be done:
	- Resolve config/console/commandline mess.  Several things are broken
	  currently: gamma, dmipmap1, ...
	- Add to API: absolute versions of Rotate and RotateWorld for csCamera.
	- Resolve confusion with SetTexture() and SetTextureHandle().  We need
	  to be consequent.
	- Consider flattening many of the routines that are now structured to
	  go through all the recursive object layers (csWorld, csSector,
	  csThing, ...)
	- Check the dependencies of libraries/COM objects and try to find
	  includes that don't belong there (like from csengine).

4-Jan-2000
	- Improved style a bit in new planeclp.h.
	- Started work on including curved surfaces to the visibility
	  algorithms.  This initially means that csThing::Merge() now actually
	  also merges curved surfaces.
	- Changed STATBSP() option so that it ignores things that contains
	  curves and doesn't try to add them to the static bsp.  This means
	  that curved surfaces will now appear correctly even if you use
	  STATBSP() but they will still not use the visibility algorithm (i.e.
	  they will be slow).
	- Thomas Hieber removed setting for manual sectoring in map2cs.  It is
	  now always on.  Textures are also exported with different name and
	  filename.
	- Thomas also fixed the release mode name for the Windows OpenGL 2D
	  driver.
	- Eric Sunshine modified the CVS snapshot-generation script to patch
	  the CVS/Root files ("cvs1" --> "cvs.crystal.sourceforge.net") such
	  that the resulting snapshot can be used later for an anonymous cvs
	  update.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed DECLARE_GROWING_ARRAY() so that it is compilable
	  on all platforms.  Recent changes to appease MSVC (the addition of a
	  floating semi-colon) were not grok'd by the NextStep compiler, so the
	  issue was resolved by eliminating the problem altogether. :-)
	- Eric Sunshine applied a patch to blocks.cpp from Artur Biesiadowski
	  <abies@pg.gda.pl> to correct a bug where the orientation of a piece
	  was different on-screen versus in-memory.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed several compilation errors in map2cs.  He also
	  eliminated some compilation warnings.
	- Eric Sunshine removed all of the remaining, obsolete references to
	  csregsvr from the documentation.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed the makefile for scftutor so that it once again
	  generates plug-in modules usable by NeXT.
	- Eric Sunshine patched up linking of the CrystalClear plug-in so that
	  it is once again usable on NeXT.
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a bug in cctest where it was corrupting the path
	  to the level file (as in "/lev/largelarge").
	- Eric Sunshine fixed a bug in the CrystalClear plug-in where it failed
	  to initialize its embedded physics configuration member.
3-Jan-2000
	- Thomas Hieber fixed a few things to make CS compilable again with
	  MSVC.
	- Norman Kramer added new keywords to world format TEX_SET and
	  TEX_SET_SELECT.  Using these new keywords it is possible to use
	  different texture sets for different instantiations of a thing
	  template.
2-Jan-2000
	- Removed another 16 bytes from csLightMap.  This change also makes
	  dynamic lighting more efficient (slightly).
	- Started cleaning up csPolyTexture.
	- Optimization in the software renderer (CreateDirtyMatrix).
	- VERY significant memory optimization.  Instead of storing four
	  lightmap structures (and lightmaps) for every polygon we now only
	  store one.  The four lightmaps were the same anyway.  I don't know
	  why there should be four.  This is left-over from a long time ago.
	  This optimization means we save 4800 bytes for every lightmapped
	  polygon with a 16x16 lightmap.
	- Changes to Map2CS from Thomas Hieber (new lightscale option).
	- Norman Kramer added a farplane to csCamera object such that
	  everything is clipped to that plane.  Default is no clipping.
	- Eric Sunshine wrote a script (bin/snapshot.py) which generates
	  snapshots and diffs of the CVS repository.  The script currently
	  runs daily and deposits the snapshots at:
	  ftp://crystal.sourceforge.net/pub/crystal/cvs-snapshots.
1-Jan-2000
	- My computer is still working :-)  And so is Crystal Space.
	- Removed 16 bytes from every csLightMap.  This means a saving of 64
	  bytes for every lightmapped polygon since there are four lightmaps
	  for the four mipmap levels.
	- Removed another 12 bytes from csLightMap.
	- Small optimization in coverage mask tree.
	- Seth Galbraith did some changes on map2cs so that textures with no
	  data are not saved.  If no texture is found then a new texture is
	  created (with no data) with the name from the map file.
	- Seth also updated DJGPP help system with some correct links.
