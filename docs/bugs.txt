PROBLEM: Bots are unstable. Cause crashes often because of faulty collision detection.
SOLUTION: probably rewrite them using CD system. However bug may be indicative
of something internal which is wrong in CS since in principle the ad hoc
CD method should work.
DIFFICULTY: moderate

PROBLEM: The missile sometimes gets stuck in the wall.
SOLUTION: This is also due to broken collision detection which should
be rewritten using the real CD system.
DIFFICULTY: moderate

PROBLEM: Lightmapping of curves is still a bit wrong.
SOLUTION: further investigation is needed.
DIFFICULTY: moderate

PROBLEM: Lightmapping in Glide is still broken.
SOLUTION: Don't know.
DIFFICULTY: Moderate?

PROBLEM: No halos in 8-bit and 32-bit display mode.
SOLUTION: 32-bit display mode is easy. It just
needs to be done. 8-bit is another matter.
DIFFICULTY: easy to moderate

PROBLEM: Halos are also missing in some 3D hardware accelerated drivers
(OpenGL and Glide).
SOLUTION: A more general solution (alpha mapped texture?) may solve all
problems at once. Or else implement it ad hoc again.
DIFFICULTY: moderate to hard

PROBLEM: No fog in hardware accelerated renderers.
SOLUTION: Either we need the solution with layered fog. Denis already
sent me code for that but I found no time to integrate it yet. Paul G
Allen is also working on fog in OpenGL.
DIFFICULTY: moderate to hard

PROBLEM: Semi-transparent textures (textures in which one color is completely
transparent and the rest is opaque) only work correctly in 16-bit color. In
32-bit color there is no transparancy and in 8-bit color there is only
transparency in some cases.
SOLUTION: For the 8-bit problem I suspect there is a problem in the texture
cache here (maybe the difference between 'white light only' and 'general color').
32-bit transparancy needs to be investigate.
DIFFICULTY: easy

PROBLEM: As far as I know the previously mentioned semi-transparent texture
feature is also not supported by the 3D hardware accelerated drivers.
SOLUTION: Look for a suitable solution.
DIFFICULTY: moderate

PROBLEM: There is no startup text in 8-bit display color.
SOLUTION: Probably easy to fix. Just need to have a look.
DIFFICULTY: easy

PROBLEM: OpenGL and Glide don't support 2D text yet.
SOLUTION: I believe Gary Haussman is busy implementing this for
OpenGL.
DIFFICULTY: moderate

PROBLEM: AMD and K6 processors seem to have problems with CS?
SOLUTION: No idea yet. This needs to be investigated. Does every AMD
and K6 owner have problems?
DIFFICULTY: moderate to hard?

PROBLEM: Precalculated lighting needs to be rewritten. For example,
reflection (with radiosity) on things does not work correctly.
SOLUTION: Either depend on the new REMPES system. But in addition we
will also want to rewrite the lighting routines so that things cast
shadows using shadow volumes instead of the current ray tracing method.
DIFFICULTY: hard

PROBLEM: Turn on 'freelook' and look around in mirror.zip. After some time
CS will crash while trying to draw a polygon.
SOLUTION: No idea?
DIFFICULTY: moderate?

PROBLEM: MazeD only works in windowed mode (on Windows).
SOLUTION: Rewrite buggy getpage() method in Windows renderer.
DIFFICULTY: easy

PROBLEM: Console only shows one line at a time in Windows.
SOLUTION: Unless we find a better solution, we should introduce
a system, where drivers can tell the engine what they can do,
and what not. I have found a fix for the console that worked nice
for me, but was a problem for Jorrit, so he removed it again. I
think we could have a variant, that will do a complete update of
the screen and one that will do a partial update.
DIFFICULTY: moderate
