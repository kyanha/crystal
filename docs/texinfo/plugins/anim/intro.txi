@subsection Introduction

@emph{Written by Michael Voase,

Crystal Space provides two basic mechanisms for animating sprites. The first
is frame based animation in which a mesh is defined in each frame and used
in a loop. The second method is skeletal animation using the @sc{cal3d} library.

For the purpose of this document I will describe frame based animation as an
@dfn{action}.  This name is coined from the class the implements frame
animations in the 3D sprite object @samp{csSpriteAction2} and has been
traditionally referred to as an @samp{action} in the sprite loader plug in.

This document presumes that you have an operational copy of Crystal Space.
For details on obtaining and building Crystal Space please refer to the
relevant sections on obtaining (@pxref{Where to Get}) and building
(@pxref{Building}) Crystal Space.

Lastly, actions are specific to sprite 3D. There is no exactly
corresponding interface to thing or ball as yet, for example. So I am also
presuming you have read to sections prior to this section about sprites, if
not, then it would be a good idea to do so before delving into this section.
