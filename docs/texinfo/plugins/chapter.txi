This chapter discusses plug-in modules and drivers which are bundled with
Crystal Space.  Applications make use of plug-in modules and drivers in order
to accomplish a variety of tasks such as communicating with 3D display
hardware or retrieving information about the mouse or keyboard.  Other
plug-in modules may provide higher-level facilities such as scripting
language support or a textual console display.

Drivers are actually a subset of the broader classification of plug-in module.
They are often considered distinct since they provide a lower-level foundation
upon which higher-level application functionality is built, but the actual
mechanism by which drivers interact with the application is identical to
that which is used by all other plug-in modules.

The mechansim by which communication is carried out with plug-in modules and
drivers is known as @sc{scf} (@pxref{SCF}), but plug-ins are actually more than
that because they work together with the system driver.  You can find all
information you need in the introduction to the simple tutorial
(@pxref{Tutorial Introduction}).
