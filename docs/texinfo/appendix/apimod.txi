@cindex Release Notes

This document provides information to aid developers during the transition
between versions of Crystal Space.

Even after a new version is released, changes may sometimes be unavoidable,
for example changes to procedures and facilities, and the @sc{api}
(@dfn{Application Programmer's Interface}) is not completely frozen (but we
will try to minimize them).

The following sections should give you a head start at trying to convert
your application from one release of Crystal Space to the next.  If you
have trouble with something that is not discussed here you should send
mail to the Crystal Space mailing list and ask for help. @xref{Mailing Lists}.
