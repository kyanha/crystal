@subsection Generating Skybox Textures

If you don't like the idea of keeping the player always inside a building and
never allowing him to look outside, then you need a skybox.  A skybox will
give the player a good illusion that there is an outside to your level.  A
skybox is a huge box with textures that shows what is outside.  However,
creating these textures is a bit tricky, otherwise, it might just look like
the inside of a textured cube.

But there is good news, because there is a free tool that is great for making
these textures.  It is called Terragen.

Please consult the terragen documentation about how to create a world, as
I will only explain, how to export the map file to Crystal Space.

@subsubheading Exporting to Crystal Space

When you are done creating your world peform the following steps:

@noindent
Open the ``Rendering Controls'' panel.

@enumerate
@item
Move your camera to the desired point in your map.
@item
Disable the ``Fixed Height Above Surface'' switch.
@item
Set ``Detail'' to @emph{Maximum}.
@item
In the ``Camera Settings'' dialog set ``Zoom Maginfication'' to ``1''.
@item
Set ``Image Size'' to 512x512 or 256x256.
@end enumerate

@end ifnotinfo
Now create six images and store them.  Use the following settings for these
images:

@quotation
@multitable @columnfractions .35 .2 .2 .2
@item @emph{Texture Name Suffix}
@tab @emph{Camera Head}
@tab @emph{Camera Pitch}
@tab @emph{Camera Bank}
@item @code{_f} @tab 0 @tab 0 @tab 0
@item @code{_r} @tab 90 @tab 0 @tab 0
@item @code{_b} @tab 180 @tab 0 @tab 0
@item @code{_l} @tab 270 @tab 0 @tab 0
@item @code{_u} @tab 0 @tab 90 @tab 0
@item @code{_d} @tab 0 @tab 270 @tab 0
@end multitable
@end quotation

Convert the generated bitmaps to a format readable by @file{map2cs} (@sc{tga},
@sc{jpg}, @sc{jpeg}, @sc{bmp}, @sc{wal}).

Then you need to add a setting ``skybox'' with the value of your basename in
the general world properties.  (For example, if your textures are called
@file{sample_f.bmp}, @file{sample_r.bmp}, you will set ``skybox'' to
``sample'').  Now every brush you assign a key ``sky'' with a value of ``1'' 
will look like your skybox.  Just try this out.  It is a really amazing 
effect.

This screenshot doesn't really do justice to the skybox effect, but it looks
quite nice, never-the-less.  To really appreciate the effect you will need to
move around a world in Crystal Space using a map enclosed within a skybox.
