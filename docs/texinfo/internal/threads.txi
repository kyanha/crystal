The Crystal Space project as such is not thread-safe. So when using
threads in combination with Crystal Space you have to be careful. However,
several parts of Crystal Space are thread-safe to some degree. This is
documented in this section. However, by default you must assume that some
Crystal Space plugin or module is not thread-safe unless it is mentioned here.

@subsubheading Threadsafe parts of Crystal Space

@itemize @bullet
@item
@sc{scf} (@pxref{SCF}) class loading/unloading is safe. This means that
@code{SCF_CREATE_INSTANCE()} and all the routines in @samp{iSCF} that have
to do with loaded classes are safe.

@item
The plugin manager is safe, thus macros such as @code{CS_LOAD_PLUGIN()},
@code{CS_LOAD_PLUGIN_ALWAYS()}, and @code{CS_QUERY_PLUGIN_CLASS()} are safe.

@item
The object registry is safe, thus macros like @code{CS_QUERY_REGISTRY()}
are safe. The @code{iObjectRegistryIterator} takes a copy of the data
over which it iterates so it will not even lock.

@item
@sc{vfs} (@pxref{VFS}) is thread-safe for most operations.  But do not work on
the same @samp{iFile} from different threads!  That is not thread-safe.  Also
the concept of the current directory is not really valid with threads.

@item
The TinyXML, XMLRead, and BinaryXML parsers are thread safe in the sense
that it is okay to create and work on separate documents in separate threads.
However it is @emph{not} okay to work on the same document in different
threads.

@item
The syntax services plugin is safe for the basic parsing tools (vectors,
matrices, reporting errors, etc.). For polygons and thing related objects
this has not yet been checked for safety.

@item
The @samp{simpcon} and @samp{csconout} output consoles are thread-safe provided
auto-updating is disabled which you can set like this:

@example
csRef<iConsoleOutput> con = ...;
con->AutoUpdate(false);
@end example

@noindent
Note that by default auto-updating is enabled!

@item
The reporter plugin is fully thread-safe.

@item
The standard reporter listener plugin is thread-safe for basic operations
but not for initialization. That should be done from the main thread.
Also note that thread-safety of the standard reporter listener depends
on thread-safety of the output console that is being used.

@item
The following mesh object and factory loaders are thread-safe provided that the
implementation of @samp{iLoaderContext} is thread-safe.  Please note that the
default @code{iLoaderContext} is @emph{not} thread-safe which makes all loader
plugins unsafe by default.

@itemize @bullet
@item
@emph{Genmesh loader}: Aside from a small design mistake with streams in
case the new renderer is used, the genmesh loader plugin is perfectly
thread-safe.

@subsubheading Threaded Loading

One important threaded section of Crystal Space is the threaded loader.  In
order to ensure that the threaded loader works correctly you must make sure
that you use thread-safe versions of the following modules in Crystal Space:

@itemize
@item
@code{iReporter} (the standard reporter is okay).
@item
@code{iReporterListener} (the standard reporter listener is okay).
@item
@code{iConsoleOutput} (@file{simpcon} and @file{csconout} are okay provided
auto-updating is disabled).
@item
@code{iLoaderContext} (the threaded loader provides a thread-safe version
of this one).
@item
@code{iDocumentSystem} (TinyXML, XMLRead, and BinaryXML are all okay).
@end itemize
