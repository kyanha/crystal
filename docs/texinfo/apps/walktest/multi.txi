@subsubsection Multi-choice commands

A multi-choice command has one or more possible values. Typing the command
without arguments will show the current value. Just type the new value after
the command to change it. Use @samp{next} to switch to the next value and
@samp{prev} to switch to the previous value. Example:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@samp{lightmap}: show the current lightmap setting

@item
@samp{lightmap reasonable}: set lightmap setting to @samp{reasonable}

@item
@samp{lightmap next}: use the next value for lightmap setting
@end itemize

The following multi-choice commands are available :

@table @code
@item inter
Choose the size of the interpolation step for simulation of perspective
correct texture mapping. Default is @samp{smart} which will base the
selection on the slope of the polygon. This is the fastest option but also
the lowest quality as there are visible pops when the slope of a polygon
changes slightly and another interpolation step is selected. Other choices
are @samp{step8}, @samp{step16}, and @samp{step32} which will set
interpolation at 8, 16, or 32 steps respectively.

@item mipmap
Selects when you want mipmapping. There are three possible values:
@samp{off}, @samp{on}, and @samp{always} (default is @samp{on}). When
mipmapping is set to @samp{off} there will be no mipmapping. When
mipmapping is set to @samp{always} the highest level of mipmapping is
always selected (results in a blurred display).

@item map
Control the display of the map. @samp{off} (default) is off. @samp{overlay}
shows the map on top of the current display. @samp{on} shows the map on its
own. While the map is active, moving with the arrow keys will move the map
instead of the display.
