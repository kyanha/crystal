@subsection Keyboard Interface
@cindex Walktest Keys
@cindex Keyboard Control, Walktest

To navigate through a map in the Watlktest application, use these keys:

@table @kbd
@item b
Turn camera the other way arround.

@item @key{SHIFT}
Makes the following movement commands faster.

@item @key{CTRL}
Makes the following movement commands very slow (for debugging).

@item @key{UP}, @key{DOWN}
Move forward or backward.

@item @key{LEFT}, @key{RIGHT}
Turn left or right.

@item @key{ALT}-@key{UP}, @key{ALT}-@key{DOWN}
Move up or down.

@item @key{ALT}-@key{LEFT}, @key{ALT}-@key{RIGHT}
Strafe left or right.

@item @key{PAGE-UP}, @key{PAGE-DOWN}
Rotate upwards or downwards.

@item 3
Change mode of movement. Default is like most 3D games do (Quake-like). If
you press this then movement will be fully 3D (Descent-like). This affects
the left and right arrow keys only.

@item \
Enable freelook mode (press once to enable, press again to disable).

@item a
Activate a trigger.

@item @key{SPACE}
Fire a missile (a moving sprite and a dynamic light).

@item l
Toggle lighting (default on).

@item e
Toggle edges on/off (default off). This is useful for debugging world
files. When edges are on you will also see where all the lights are.
Clicking on a light will select it (useful for the next key).

@item @key{SHIFT}-e
Toggle frustrum viewing on/off (default off). This is useful for debugging
the engine. With this option you see the view frustrum around the selected
light (see the @key{e} key above). The white outlines are the shapes where
the light may hit the polygon (ignoring radius of the light). The red lines
connect the vertices of every outline with the center of the light.

@item c
Load coordinates from the @file{coord} file and jump camera to that
location.

@item @key{SHIFT}-c
Save current coordinates to the @file{coord} file.

@item @key{ALT}-c
Show where we are (current sector and coordinates). Output is sent to the file
@file{debug.txt}.

@item @key{CTRL}-c
Toggle display of coordinates while we are running.

@item q
Quit program.

@item t
Toggle texture mapping or flat drawing.

@item @key{SHIFT}-t
Enable mipmapping. Three possible states:
@table @samp
@item on
Mipmapping is used according to the distance (default).

@item off
Mipmapping is never used.

@item always
Mipmapping is always used.
@end table

@item @key{ALT}-t
Toggle texel filtering (default off). This is an experimental feature
which will slow down the engine considerably and also introduces some
artifacts on the borders of polygons.

@item @key{CTRL}-t
Turn on/off the display of things (same as @samp{things} command).
Default is on.

@item i
Dump information about the texture cache.

@item r
Clear the texture cache.

@item p
Do a performance test on the current location.

@item @key{SHIFT}-p
Toggle perfect texture mapping on/off (default off).

@item @key{ALT}-p
Switch between @samp{smart}, @samp{step16}, and @samp{step32} scanline
interpolation modes.  For more info on the @samp{inter} command,
@ref{Console}.

@item m
Toggle @samp{map} mode.

@item @key{ALT}-a
Make a screenshot in PCX format. This currently only seems to work in the
DJGPP port.

@item g
Increase gamma level of display.

@item @key{SHIFT}-g
Decrease gamma level of display.

@item f
Increase FOV value.

@item @key{SHIFT}-f
Decrease FOV value.

@item @key{ALT}-f
Toggle FPS dipslay.

@item @key{TAB}
Toggle input console.  For a list of commands, @xref{Console}.

@item 1
Experimental: create a new pulsating dynamic light at your location.

@item @key{SHIFT}-1
Delete the last created dynamic light.

@item @key{ALT}-1
Delete all dynamic lights.

@item 2
@emph{Broken}.

@item @key{SHIFT}-2
@emph{Broken}.

@item @key{F1}
(X version only) Used when simulating a 15/16-bit display on an 8-bit
display (@code{-depth} option). This will compute an optimal palette for
the current frame.

@item @key{F2}
(X version only) Used when simulating a 15/16-bit display on an 8-bit
display (@code{-depth} option). This will compute a greyscale palette and
use that instead of the standard 3:3:2 truecolor palette.

@item @key{F3}
(X version only) Restore the standard 3:3:2 palette used for simulating
15/16-bit on an 8-bit display.

@item d
Assigned to @samp{debug0 toggle}.

@item @key{SHIFT}-d
Assigned to @samp{debug1}.

@item *
Enable/disable collision detection.
