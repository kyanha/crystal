@section Platform Specific Instructions

When working with Crystal Space, always keep in mind that this is a
multiplatform project. Sometimes not all features will work correctly on all
platforms. Sometimes a specific port may even be broken due to changes in other
ports. Since the introduction of @sc{cvs}, this is usually only for a short
time so if you got your version from @sc{cvs}, it usually pays off to post a
message describing the problems to the Crystal Space mailing list describing
you problem and include the exact error messages. If you wait a while, this
will probably be fixed, or at least be worked around. @xref{Mailing Lists}.

For some ports there is additional reference information explaining the
internal workings of the port. When such detailed information exists, you will
find a reference to it from within the instructions in this section.
