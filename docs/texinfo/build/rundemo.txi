@cindex Quick Start

Once you have built the Crystal Space system and its demonstration applications
you may be eager to test them out.  This section will give you the opportunity
to do so without forcing you to wade through an overabundance of explanations.
Later sections will describe options and applications in more detail, but
for now, sit back and have some fun.

Typically, the executable for each application and its support files will be
located in the same directory, though this is not strictly necessary.  The map
files are generally placed in the @file{CS/data} directory, but this not
required.  Please note that the map @sc{zip} files should @emph{not} be
unpacked.  Crystal Space can read these files directly.

In this example, we will run @samp{walktest}, the quintessential Crystal Space
demonstration program.  To run @samp{walktest} with a specific map you can
specify the map name on the command line:

@example
./walktest @var{map}
@end example

Replace @var{map} with any map file name which you have downloaded and
placed in your @file{CS/data} directory.  For instance:

@example
walktest flarge
@end example

If your map is not one of those from the CS homepage, you may also have to add
it to @file{vfs.cfg}.  Look at the entries for the other maps to see how to do
this.

Note that the very first time you start a lightmap based map (like
@samp{flarge}) you must use the @samp{-relight} commandline option to update
the lightmaps.

You can also use other command line parameters when running Crystal Space
applications.  @xref{Common Command Line Options}.  Detailed setup can be done
in the configuration file.  @xref{Configuration File}.  For Walktest, in-game
setup can be done via the console.  @xref{Walktest Console Commands}.
