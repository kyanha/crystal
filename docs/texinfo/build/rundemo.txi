Once you have built the Crystal Space system and its demonstration applications
you may be eager to test them out.  This section will give you the opportunity
to do so without forcing you to wade through an overabundance of explanations.
Later sections will describe options and applications in more detail, but
for now, sit back and have some fun.

Typically, the executable for each application and its support files will be
located in the same directory, though this is not strictly necessary.  The map
files are generally placed in the @file{CS/data} directory, but this not
required.  Please note that the map @sc{zip} files should @emph{not} be
unpacked.  Crystal Space can read these files directly.

On @sc{gnu} Linux:

If you see the following error @samp{error while loading shared libraries:
libcrystalspace-1.x.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
directory}

Crystal Space now creates and uses shared libraries. Inorder to run the demo
applications you need to export the @emph{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} to where the Crystal
Space root folder is currently located e.g.

@example
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/me/CS_latest
@end example

In the following examples we will run @samp{walktest}, the quintessential
Crystal Space demonstration program in various ways.

When running @samp{walktest} for the first time we must update it's lightmaps.
This is accomplished by adding @samp{-relight} to the command line.

On Windows:

@example
walktest.exe -relight
@end example

On other Operating Systems:

@example
./walktest -relight
@end example

In this example, we will run @samp{walktest} and specify the map it should load
and use.

On Windows:

@example
walktest.exe @var{map}
@end example

On other Operating Systems:

@example
./walktest @var{map}
@end example

Replace @var{map} with any map file name which you have downloaded and
placed in your @file{CS/data} directory.  For instance:

@example
walktest partsys
@end example

If your map is not one of those from the @sc{cs} homepage, you may also
have to add it to @file{vfs.cfg}.  Look at the entries for the other maps
to see how to do this.

Note when running lightmap based maps you must as above in our initial example
update it's lightmaps.  This is accomplished as stated by adding @samp{-relight}
to the command line. Do not worry about this too much, if lightmaps are out
of date you will in most cases be prompted of the fact in your terminal and
advised to re-run the application with @samp{-relight}.

You can also use other command line parameters when running Crystal Space
applications.  @xref{Common Command Line Options}.  Detailed setup can be done
in the configuration file.  @xref{Configuration File}.  For Walktest, in-game
setup can be done via the console.  @xref{Walktest Console Commands}.
