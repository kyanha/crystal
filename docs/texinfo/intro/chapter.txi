@cindex Introduction

CrystalSpace is a 6DOF 3D engine, it is not in itself a game and is still
very much in development.  Everyone who feels inclined can contribute to the
source. There are several things that still need to be done. For more
information about what is missing and a list of current known bugs,
@xref{Todo}.

CrystalSpace is free and should remain free.  CrystalSpace falls under the
GNU copyleft license for libraries.  To see what this means read the license
that should be included with this archive. @xref{License}. In short it means
that you are allowed to use Crystal Space in your products.  You are even
allowed to sell your product using Crystal Space provided Crystal Space
itself remains free.

Please read the FAQ if you have a question.  If you don't find the answer
there you can always E-Mail the mailing lists. @xref{FAQ}, or
