This section describes the installation procedure of the @code{io_scene_cs} add-on script.

@subsubheading Getting the add-on

The @code{io_scene_cs} add-on script is available in the Crystal Space package,
within the @samp{CS/scripts/blender} directory. The script should be used with
the corresponding version of Crystal Space.

@subsubheading Installing the add-on

Since the script is composed of several files, you cannot simply use the @samp{Install Add-On}
button of the Blender interface. Instead, you need to copy manually the folder
@samp{CS/scripts/blender/io_scene_cs} into the Blender add-ons directory
(@samp{blender/$version/scripts/addons}). By default, this directory should be at:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@samp{Windows 7}: @file{C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\%version%\scripts\addons}
@item
@samp{Windows XP}: @file{C:\Documents and Settings\%username%\Application Data\Blender Foundation\Blender\%version%\scripts\addons}
@item
@samp{Linux}: @file{/home/$username/.blender/$version/scripts/addons}
@end itemize

See
@url{http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Extensions/Python/Add-Ons, the official Blender manual}
for more information on the actual process.

@subsubheading Enabling the add-on

Blender add-ons are found in the @samp{Add-Ons} tab of the @samp{Files > User Preferences}
window. Once an add-on has been installed, it has to be enabled before it can be used.
Simply place a check mark on the @samp{Enable an addon} box of the add-on called
@samp{Import-Export: Export Crystal Space 3D format}. In this panel, you can define
the default export path that will be used by the add-on to export your Blender scenes.

If the add-on doesn't appear in the list, then this probably means that the installation
was not made correctly. Please check the directory where you placed the @code{io_scene_cs}
add-on script, or check the Blender console for any problems.

The new export functionality is now integrated into Blender and can be used. If you want to
disable the functionality, uncheck the box. To get more information on the add-on you can
press the arrow at the left of the entry. Finally, this add-on can be enabled everytime
you start Blender simply by saving your user preferences (@samp{Save As Default} at the
bottom of the window).

@subsubheading Testing the presence of the add-on

Close the Blender @samp{User Preferences} window, then go and check if the
@samp{Crystal Space Export} panel appears in the @samp{Render} context of the
@samp{Properties} (or @samp{Buttons}) window (it can appear either at the top
or at the bottom of the context).

@picturess{content,blender,io_scene_cs_interface}

If you don't see the interface, then you may:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Scroll either to the top and to the bottom of the @samp{Render} context since
the Crystal Space panel may appear in both places.
@item
Check that you have the exporter add-on correctly installed and enabled.
@item
Check the @url{http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Interface/Window_system/Console_window, Blender console window}
to see if there are any error messages about the exporter. In this case, you may consider
to @ref{Feedback, create a bug report}.
@end itemize


@subsubheading Configuring Crystal Space

Finally, if you want to test your exported meshes and models, you should have a valid
Crystal Space package installed on your computer, with the @samp{CRYSTAL} environment
variable pointing to the installation directory. Although this variable is not technically
needed to use the @code{io_scene_cs} script, you will need it in order to view your
exported files and to use the @samp{Export and Run} functionality of the script.
For more information on the way to do this,
