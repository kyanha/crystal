@subsection System Configuration
@cindex Configuration, System

This section describes how the base system can be configured via a
configuration file.  The default values are stored in
@file{CS/data/config/system.cfg}, except the list of default @sc{scf} classes
to instantiate, for which no default exists.  Typically, the list of default
requested classes will appear in an application's own configuration file.

@subsubheading List of @sc{scf} Classes

The most important part of the system configuration is the list of @sc{scf}
classes to instantiate by default.  A class is instantiated with the following
line:

@example
System.Plugins.InterfaceName = ClassName
@end example

@samp{System.Plugins.} is obligatory and tells the system to instantiate the
class at startup.  The @samp{InterfaceName} specifies the name of the abstract
@sc{scf} interface which this module is expected to implement.  For example the
interface name @samp{iGraphics3D} means that this plug-in is used for 3D
rendering.  Note that it is not possible to load more than one module with the
same functionality identifier.

Finally, @samp{ClassName} determines which @sc{scf} class to instantiate.  The
class you mention here must be designed for the purpose for which you try to
use it.  In other words, it must implement the interface specified with
@samp{InterfaceName} (it may also implement additional interfaces).  For
example, if you load a sound driver with the @samp{iGraphics3D}, the
application will not be able to instantiate the driver because it does not
implement that interface.

Note that some modules depend on others. If module A depends on module B,
then you must first load B, then A. If you don't do this then module A will
usually fail to initialize.

Here is an example of a line from the configuration file:

@example
System.Plugins.iGraphics3D = crystalspace.graphics3d.opengl
@end example

This line instantiates the @sc{scf} class @samp{crystalspace.graphics3d.opengl}
(the OpenGL graphics driver) which implements the abstract @samp{iGraphics3D}
interface, and makes the instantiated object available via shared object
registry.

The interface name mentioned above is exactly the name of the C++ abstract
interface which modules implement.  Some of the common ones which you will see
or use in configuration files are listed below.

@table @code
@item iVFS
The virtual file system.  Presently, there is only one @sc{vfs} implementation,
and it is named @samp{crystalspace.kernel.vfs}.

@item iGraphics3D
A 3D renderer.  Some possible values include

@table @code
@item crystalspace.graphics3d.software
Uses the platform-specific 2D canvas to perform 3D graphics operations.

@item crystalspace.graphics3d.software.offscreen
This is a variant of the software renderer that renders to a buffer in memory,
not to the screen.

@item crystalspace.graphics3d.opengl
Uses OpenGL for 3D output, and by this takes advantage of hardware
acceleration. Requires installed OpenGL run-time libraries.

@subsubheading Other Low-Level Configuration Options

Apart from the list of plug-in modules, the following keys are recognized:

@table @code
@item System.UserConfig = true
Specifies whether or not user-specific configuration information should be
used and maintained. @xref{Config PerUser}.
@end table
