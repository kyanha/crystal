After you have created your sprite you are now probably wondering
what you can do to bring your creation to life? In this section
we explore the two ways in which you can introduce animation
sequences to your sprite.

For the Crystal Space developer, there are currently two options
for the production and management of sprite animation. The first
option is frame based animation, referred to as an action, and the
second is skeletal animation (which uses the external @sc{cal3d}
library). As of writing this document, the two are separate.
However, in the not too distant future I expect that this situation
will change.
