animations.

@subsubsection General concepts and examples

In an animation blending tree, the combination of animations is made by creating
a tree of animation nodes that will blend the position and orientation of each
bone of the skeleton of the Animesh, hence the name of the method. The structure
of the tree, i.e. the choice of animation nodes and the way they are combined,
will affect the behavior of the animation.

Each leaf of the blending tree is either a raw animation sequence (user-defined
by an artist or acquired by technologies such as motion capture), or a procedural
node, i.e. a node dynamically generating an animation. The other nodes in the
tree are used for the combination of sub-trees in order to achieve complex
animations and behaviors.

@subsubheading First example: a windmill

A windmill is extremely simple since it has a priori only a single animation: the
wheel turning. This animation will be defined in a very simple animation sequence
(a @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonAnimation}), with e.g. two key frames.

In order to animate the mesh of your windmill, you would create a blending tree
containing a single animation node, a @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonAnimationNodeFactory},
that would simply play the wheel animation. Before that, you need to configure the
@code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonAnimationNodeFactory} in order to play cyclically,
otherwise the animation will be stopped after it has been played once.

The blending tree has a single node and looks like this:

@ifnottex
@example
   CS::Animation::iSkeletonAnimationNode
@end example
@end ifnottex

Now, say that there is more wind, and that you want to change the speed of the
rotation of the wheel. For that, you would access the @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonAnimationNode}
in the blending tree (using e.g. @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonAnimNode::FindNode()}),
and change the animation speed with @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonAnimNode::SetPlaybackSpeed()}.

@subsubheading Second example: debugging your windmill

Event if the first windmill example is very simple, it might just not work and
your wheel just don't do what you want. A way to analyze a bit further what is
going on is to use a @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonDebugNode}. With this node,
you would be able to display the structure of the skeleton of your mesh, and
hopefully to understand your problem.

In order to use the @samp{Debug} node, you would just add it at the top of your
blending tree, i.e. the root, with the the @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonAnimationNode}
as a child node. Now, when the animation is played, both nodes are activated,
and you can either animate your windmill and visualize the skeleton.

The structure of the blending tree now looks like this:

@ifnottex
@example
     CS::Animation::iSkeletonDebugNode
                      |
                      |
   CS::Animation::iSkeletonAnimationNode
@end example
@end ifnottex

@subsubheading Third example: dynamic behavior

Now, say that you have several different animations of your wheel turning at
various speed, e.g. with the wheel starting to roll out when the speed is high.
You may use a @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonSpeedNode} that will take all these
animations as input child nodes, and combine them in order to generate a new
animation, whatever the rotation speed asked by the user.

Say also, that you want to attach some pieces of tissue to the wheel, and that
you want those pieces to ba animated through soft body physical simulation. For
that, you would use a @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonRagdollNode} in order to
create the physical rigid bodies that will represent the wheel (you would need
to provide the collision model of your animesh for that). Then you would create
a Genmesh animated by the soft body controller, and attach it to the rigid bodies
of your wheel.

Now, the structure of the blending tree looks like this:

@ifnottex
@example
                                    CS::Animation::iSkeletonDebugNode
                                                     |
                                                     |
                                   CS::Animation::iSkeletonRagdollNode
                                                     |
                                                     |
                                    CS::Animation::iSkeletonSpeedNode
                                                     |
                          ----------------------------------------------------------
                          |                                                        |
       CS::Animation::iSkeletonAnimationNode                    CS::Animation::iSkeletonAnimationNode
             ('normal speed' animation)                                 ('high speed' animation)
@end example
@end ifnottex

@subsubheading Other examples

Other examples of setup of animations trees and general Animesh usage can be
found in the @code{avatartest} application. The @code{csbias} demo is also another
interesting example.


@node Animation Nodes, , Animation Nodes General, Animation Blending Trees
@subsubsection List of animation nodes

Here is the extensive list of the animation nodes that are shipped within
Crystal Space.

You can find an example of loading of these animation nodes from a Crystal Space
library file in @file{CS/data/krystal/anims_idle.cslib}.

@subsubheading Raw animation

These are the objects @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonAnimationNode} and
@code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonAnimationNodeFactory}.

This animation node allows the storage and playback of raw animation data. Key
frames are defined with a time stamp and some key values for the orientation and
position of the bones of the skeleton. When playing back the animation, the data
will be interpolated between the available key frames.

The node can be configured to be played cyclically or not.

The animations stored in this node are usually defined by an artist. They can
also be loaded from motion captured data using the @ref{Animesh Tools, dedicated tool}.

@subsubheading Finite State Machine

These are the objects @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonFSMNode} and
@code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonFSMNodeFactory}.

This animation node allows to control the animation of the skeleton by navigating
into the states of a Finite State Machine (FSM). This node is useful e.g. to drive
the locomotion and the actions of a character.

Each state of the FSM corresponds to an animation child node that will be played
while the FSM is in that state. A crossfade and a transition sub-node can also be
defined between the states of the FSM, they will be used when the FSM is switched
between the two states, allowing for a smooth transition between two states.

Automatic transitions can also be defined, they will be followed automatically at
the end of the current playing state if no other state has been asked by the user
to switch to.

@subsubheading Blending node

These are the objects @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonBlendNode} and
@code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonBlendNodeFactory}.

This node will blend together any number of child nodes. Each child node can receive
a different weight in order to parameterize their influence.

@subsubheading Random node

These are the objects @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonRandomNode} and
@code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonRandomNodeFactory}.

This node will play randomly one of its child node, allowing for more varied animations.

@subsubheading Priority

These are the objects @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonPriorityNode} and
@code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonPriorityNodeFactory}.

This node blends its child nodes according to their priority. It is useful e.g. to
add a secondary motion on top of a base animation while preserving most of the base
animation.

@subsubheading LookAt

These are the objects @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonLookAtNode} and
@code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonLookAtNodeFactory}.

This node aligns automatically some bone with a user-defined target. It is useful e.g.
to breathe life into a character by generating an active interaction from the character.

@subsubheading Speed

These are the objects @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonSpeedNode} and
@code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonSpeedNodeFactory}.

This node takes as child nodes the animations of the mesh moving at different speed,
e.g. idle, walking, running, sprinting, and combines these animations to achieve any
desired custom speed.

@subsubheading Ragdoll

These are the objects @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonRagdollNode} and
@code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonRagdollNodeFactory}.

This node allows the interaction between the Animesh mesh and the physical
simulation, allowing to either control the animation of the mesh through physical
simulation, and to hit and collide with the other objects of the simulation.

On demand, this node can create automatically the rigid bodies and joints for the
bones of the skeleton of the Animesh, these rigid bodies will collide and interact
with the physical environment.

The bones can be set in dynamic state e.g. to have a character falling realistically
in a stairwell, or in kinematic state in order for the mesh to interact with the
environment while being animated by the classical animation method. This allows for
example to attach to the mesh some external objects or clothes that will be
physically animated while colliding with the character (i.e. its bones in kinematic
state).

Both states can also be combined to achieve effects such as the main body of the
avatar classically animated, and sub-trees such as hair, clothes or accessories
animated by the physical simulation.

@subsubheading Inverse Kinematics

These are the objects @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonIKNode} and
@code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonIKNodeFactory}.

This node generates an animation that places a bone end effector at a specific
position and orientation. It allows e.g. a character to grab an object regardless
of the relative position of the character and the object.

There are two different implementation of this node:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Using the Cyclic Coordinate Descent algorithm (object @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonIKCCDNodeFactory}).
This method is quite robust, but has some high computation costs.
@item
Using the physical simulation (object @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonIKPhysicalNodeFactory}).
This method has the advantage of being able to react realistically to collisions on
the path of the arm to the effector, the drawback is that the physical simulation may
behave strangely if the motion of the target of the effector is not manipulated wisely.
@end itemize

@subsubheading Retarget

These are the objects @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonRetargetNode} and
@code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonRetargetNodeFactory}.

This node allows to retarget (or redirect) an animation that was defined for one skeleton
to another skeleton. It is useful for example to re-use animations or to input
motion captured data into your Animesh. However, the two skeletons must still have
a similar topology and limb proportions, otherwise the results won't look good.

@subsubheading Debug

These are the objects @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonDebugNode} and
@code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonDebugNodeFactory}.

This node currently simply allows to display the state of part or the whole skeleton.

@subsubheading Noise

These are the objects @code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonNoiseNode} and
@code{CS::Animation::iSkeletonNoiseNodeFactory}.

This node can generate animations through pseudo-random noise functions such as
the Perlin noise. This allows to breathe life into an entity by adding some random
variations in its motion.
