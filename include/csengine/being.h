/**
 * csCollider is a generic class.  All objects which participate in
 * collisions are csColliders (walls, stairs, bullets, monsters etc.)
 * but moving objects need to keep some state information.  To
 * serve this purpose there is a csBeing class (maybe a better name can
 * be thought of). csBeings move around and can hit things.  They maybe
 * able to climb a stair case or climb a wall.
 * They fall under the effect or gravity and may slip or bounce.
 * Under certain conditions they may be able to fly or move through
 * a wall etc.  The logic for this should be handled by the function
 * csBeing::CollisionDetect ().  The Bot for instance should subclass
 * from csBeing, or it maybe able to use csBeing as is.   To create your
 * own Monsters you should subclass csBeing and look at the
 * csBeing::CollisionDetect () code which you may need to overrule with
 * you own method.
