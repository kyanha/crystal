   * Given two positions in the world, try to find the shortest distance (using
   * portals if needed) between them and return the final squared distance.
   * <p>
   * Note! This function will ignore all portals if the source and destination
   * sectors are the same. Even if there might be a possible shorter path
   * between the two positions using some space warping portal. An exception
   * to this is if the distance is greater then the max distance. In that
   * case this function will attempt to try out portals in the current sector
   * to see if there is a shorter path anyway.
   * <p>
   * Note that this routine will ignore visibility. It will simply calculate
   * the distance between the two points through some portal path. However,
   * this function will check if the portal is oriented towards the source
   * point (i.e it doesn't ignore visibility with regards to backface culling).
   * <p>
   * Note that this function only considers the center point of a portal
   * for calculating the distance. This might skew results with very
   * big portals.
   * <p>
   * This function will correctly account for space warping portals.
   * <p>
   * \param source is the source position to start from.
   * \param sourceSector is the sector for that position.
   * \param dest is the destination position to start from.
   * \param destSector is the destination for that position.
   * \param maxradius is the maximum radius before we stop recursion.
   * \return the squared distance between the two points or a negative
   * number if the distance goes beyond the maximum radius.
