 * performing string comparisons, you instead compare the numeric string ID's.
 *
 * As a convenience, the csInitializer class creates a string set at
 * application initialization time and inserts it into the global object
 * registry (iObjectRegistry).  To obtain a reference this shared string set
 * (which may be desirable when modules need to share string ID's), use a code
 * snippet similar to the following:

 *   object_reg, "crystalspace.shared.stringset");
