/**
 * The iView class represents a viewport and encapsulates the top-level renderer
 * interface.
 *
 * It is basically a camera and a clipper, and is used to define how the view
 * from the camera must be rendered into the render target.
 *
 * The clipper is used to speed up the rendering process by excluding the objects
 * that are not visible. It is returned by GetClipper() and can be defined either
 * through a rectangle (methods SetWidth(), SetHeight() and SetRectangle())
 * or through a custom polygon (methods ClearView(), AddViewVertex() and
 * RestrictClipperToScreen()).
 *
 * The clipper and view dimensions doesn't need to be updated if
 * SetAutoResize() is set to \a true. If no clipper is provided and SetAutoResize()
 * is set to \a true, then a rectangular one will be used with the size of the full
 * screen.
 *
 * The list of meshes to be rendered from the scene can also be restricted
 * using the method GetMeshFilter().
 *
 * \remarks The view coordinates are vertically mirrored in comparison to screen
 * space, i.e. y=0 is at the bottom of the viewport, y=GetHeight() at the top.
 *
 * Main creators of instances implementing this interface:
 * - Applications using csView.
 *   
 * Main ways to get pointers to this interface:
 * - Application stores it.
 *   
 * Main users of this interface:
 * - Application uses it.
