 * for creating these textures and filling them with the correct
 * info. The csTextureHandle class is private to the 3D driver, the
 * driver clients see just the iTextureHandle interface.
 * <p>
 * The handle is initialized by giving the 3D driver a iImage object.
 * Later the renderer will create mipmaps and 2D textures are created.
 * The texture manager will release its reference to the image when no
