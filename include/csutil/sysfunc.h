/**
 * Implements a default run-loop for stand-alone applications.<p>
 * This function implements a run-loop for stand-alone applications which do
 * not provide their own run-loop.  You only need to call this function if your
 * application does not otherwise implement its own run-loop.  For example, an
 * existing Microsoft Windows-based application will already have a run-loop
 * which processes the Windows event-queue, among other tasks.  Such an
 * application should not call this function, since doing so would interrupt
 * the existing run-loop and prevent it from running.  For each iteration of
 * the run-loop, this function increments the Crystal Space virtual clock (if
 * it is present in the shared-object registry at the time of the call to this
 * function) and processes the Crystal Space event queue (which must be present
 * in the shared-object registry at the time of the call to this function).
 * This function only returns after a csevBroadcast message has been received
 * in the Crystal Space event queue with command code cscmdQuit.  The return
 * value of this function indicates whether or not the run-loop was actually
 * able to run.  If there was a problem starting the run-loop, then `false' is
 * returned, otherwise `true' is returned.

 * platform-specific components.  Typically, this function is automatically
 * called by the higher-level csInitializer::CreateEnvironment(), however if
 * you are performing application initialization manually, you should call it
